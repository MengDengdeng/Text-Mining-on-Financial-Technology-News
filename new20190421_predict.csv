2," April 19 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd  said on Friday a report by the Nikkei that it would slash production this year was ""completely incorrect"" and that it had lodged a complaint with the business daily, in an unusually strong denial of a media report in Japan. The comment came after the Nikkei, revered in Japan for its business news and known for its market-moving scoops and previews, said Nissan would cut its global production by about 15 percent for the current fiscal year ending March 2020. The move would mark a shift away from the aggressive expansion campaign promoted by ousted former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, the Nikkei said. ""Nissan's production plan for the current fiscal year will be disclosed on May 14, when the company announces its financial results for the previous fiscal year,"" said the maker of the Rogue sport-utility vehicle and Altima sedan. The Nikkei, which also owns Britain'sFinancial Times newspaper, confirmed it had received the complaint from Nissan. It said it would continue to cover the issue and promptly report all the facts once they become clear. The newspaper had earlier reported that Nissan aimed to produce about 4.6 million units in fiscal 2019, citing plans being communicated to the automaker's suppliers. The move was likely to impact earnings and could cast a pall over Nissan's alliance with French automaker Renault SA , the Nikkei said without elaborating. That would be the steepest production cut in more than a decade by the Japanese automaker, as it battles weak sales in overseas markets including the United States where it plans to scale back sales operations, according to the Nikkei. Earlier this year, Nissan, which has been battling falling sales, lowered its operating profit forecast for the current fiscal year to 450 billion yen ($4 billion), 22 percent lower than a year earlier. It would be Nissan's lowest profit since 2013. Japanese companies typically respond to media reports by saying they were not the source of the information and, depending on the content of the report, that they may be considering various options and that nothing had been decided. It is rare for a Japanese firm to say it has issued a strong rebuke to a media outlet. Shares in Nissan, mired in a financial misconduct scandal involving Ghosn and the company itself, closed down 2.2 percent on Friday, versus a 0.5 percent rise in the broader market .",,"April 19, 2019, 03:20:00 AM EDT",Nissan slams output cut report as 'completely incorrect'

4," By Hyunjoo Jin and Sanjana  Shivdas SEOUL, April 19 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co  has appointed Jose Munoz as global chief operating officer and Americas chief, tapping a man formerly considered an ally and potential successor of Nissan Motor Co Ltd's  ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn. Munoz is the latest foreign executive to be brought in to a South Korean automaker dominated by lifelong loyalists, as heir-apparent Euisun Chung strengthens control of the conglomerate chaired by his aging father. It also comes as Munoz's former boss at Nissan sits in a Tokyo jail awaiting trial for financial misconduct. The November arrest of Ghosn, who denies wrongdoing, prompted an internal investigation into corporate governance at the Japanese automaker in which Munoz was cited as a ""person of interest"". Munoz resigned in January, saying Nissan was involved in matters that would divert its focus and that he looked forward to continuing to assist with investigations. At the time, he was Nissan'sChina head and chief performance officer - responsible for Nissan's results and global strategies - having previously overseen operations in North America. At his new employer, Munoz will succeed William Lee, who has led Hyundai's North America business since June. On May 1, he will effectively assume two newly created roles: Global Chief Operating Officer and Head of Hyundai Motor Americas Region. ""(Munoz's) focus will be to deliver profitable growth and to improve overall performance of Hyundai Motor,"" the automaker said in a statement issued on Thursday in the United States. He will be based in California and report to ""top leadership"" in Seoul, Hyundai said.  OUTSIDERS Since the promotion last year of Euisun Chung, the 48-year-old Hyundai Motor Group scion has in turn promoted executives brought in from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and automakers including Germany'sBMW AG . ""Hyundai needs to change, but it is changing too fast, which could lead to internal conflicts and communication problems,"" said Lee Hang-koo, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. ""If the Ghosn scandal is not resolved well, the appointment could adversely affect the company's image and lead to doubts about Chung's personnel management capability,"" he said. Munoz, 53, joined Nissan in 2004 in Europe and led its expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. Nissan raised its U.S. market share under Munoz and posted record sales, though sales have since weakened. Hyundai, meanwhile, was an outperformer during the 2009 global economic downturn but has seen its U.S. market share slip in recent years, in part due to its delayed response to the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles.",,"April 18, 2019, 09:20:00 PM EDT","Hyundai hires former Ghosn ally Munoz as global COO, Americas head"
5," By Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 (Reuters) - Uber's autonomous vehicle unit has raised $1 billion from a consortium of investors including SoftBank Group Corp , giving the company a much-needed funding boost for its pricey self-driving ambitions on the eve of its public stock offering. Uber Technologies Inc  said on Thursday that the investment valued its Advanced Technologies Group, which works to develop autonomous driving technology, at $7.25 billion. SoftBank will invest $333 million from its $100 billionVision Fund, while Toyota Motor Corp and automotive company Denso Corp will combined invest $667 million. The funding allows Uber to transfer some of the substantial cost of developing self-driving cars onto outside investors. That is likely to appease some investor concerns over Uber's spending on the autonomous unit, which has topped $1 billion since the program started in 2016. The business unit brings in no meaningful revenue for Uber, which last year lost $3.03 billion. The company is not even offering free rides in the robot cars to passengers, like some of its rivals are, following a fatal crash last year in Arizona involving an Uber self-driving SUV. Uber released its IPO filing this month and is preparing to launch is ""roadshow,"" when it will pitch its company prospective investors, the week of April 29, setting up for an early May debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Uber is expected to raise $10 billion at a $90 billion to $100 billion valuation, at least an 18 percent jump from its current $76 billion valuation. As part of the deal, ATG becomes its own legal entity but remains under the control of Uber with its financial performance folded into Uber's. A new ATG board will be formed, with six seats from Uber, one from SoftBank and one from Toyota. Eric Meyhofer, currently the head of ATG, will take the title of CEO and report to the new board. Such sizeable deals are unusual for companies so close to an IPO, because bringing in large new investors changes the company's capital structure. The deal, however, will almost certainly require approval from the inter-agency regulatory group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). A law enacted last year expands that group's powers to review minority stakes by foreign investors in startups with certain sensitive technologies, and self-driving technology is widely considered to have defense applications.",,"April 18, 2019, 08:30:00 PM EDT","Uber lands $1 billion from SoftBank, Toyota for self-driving unit"
6," April 18 (Reuters) - American Media Inc (AMI)  said on Thursday it was selling its National Enquirer tabloid to James Cohen, whose family owns a magazine distributor and used to own the Hudson chain of airport newsstands. The National Enquirer had admitted to paying hush money to help U.S. President Donald Trump get elected and been accused of attempting to blackmail Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The weekly tabloid, along with two of its sister publications, will be purchased by Cohen. The Washington Post reported the sale was for $100 million. The companies did not respond to Reuters' request for comment on the price. The deal comes a week after AMI said it was looking at ""strategic options"" for the National Enquirer as well as for the Globe and National Examiner brands. The sale is expected to reduce AMI's debt to $355 million. Last week, the New York Times reported that owners of the National Enquirer were in talks to sell the tabloid to  California-based billionaire Ronald Burkle. Paul Pope, one of the heirs of the National Enquirer founder, Generoso Pope Jr., had also been in the list of bidders, according to media reports. On Tuesday, Pope dropped his bid to buy the supermarket tabloid from American Media, the New York Post reported. Over its 92-year history, the National Enquirer has enticed readers in supermarket checkout lines with sensational headlines and photos about celebrities.

17," By Nandita Bose WASHINGTON, April 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday said it has launched a pilot program in New York that allows consumers dependant on food stamps to use them to buy groceries online, a move that is likely to boost sales at retailers like Walmart Inc  and Amazon.com Inc . Both companies are participating in the initial pilot launch with Wakefern Food Corp'sShopRite supermarket chain expected to join the program early next week, the USDA said. Walmart will offer the service in upstate New York, while ShopRite and Amazon will service the New York City area. ""People who receive SNAP benefits should have the opportunity to shop for food the same way more and more Americans shop for food - by ordering and paying for groceries online,"" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a statement. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, already has 40 stores in other parts of the country that allow shoppers to pay for groceries ordered online using food stamps. The new program will expand to Alabama, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington, and additional  retailers are expected to take part, the USDA said. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company has nearly 275 stores that offer grocery pickup in the nine states eligible for the pilot. Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, in a blog post on Thursday said New York customers can shop on AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry without requiring a membership fee. ""Amazon believes the program will dramatically increase access to food for more remote customers and help to mitigate the public health crisis of food deserts,"" the retailer said.",,"April 18, 2019, 12:56:00 PM EDT",U.S. pilot program allows online grocery shopping with food stamps
18," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips There are two pieces of very good news this week if you are an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) investor worried slumping iPhone sales could get even worse. The first was a dramatic end to the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) lawsuit, saving the day for the prospect of 5G iPhones next year. The second had nothing to do with Apple, but it's sure taking some pressure off AAPL's incremental approach to smartphone design. Samsung's new $1,980 Galaxy Fold smartphone was released to reviewers this week and quickly ran into a storm of negative press. The smartphone with the futuristic new folding screen has suffered catastrophic failure for multiple high profile journalists.  Depending on how this plays out, Samsung's growing PR problem is likely to be good news for Apple stock. At the end of February, Samsung made a big splash with the announcement of the Galaxy Fold. The company's new flagship smartphone featured a futuristic Infinity Flex folding display that transformed it from a phone to a 7.3-inch tablet. Launching on April 26, the radical new smartphone would be priced starting at a whopping $1,980. It would also be the first folding smartphone to be widely commercially available in the U.S. China's Huawei has also announced a folding smartphone - but the company lacks an American presence. So far, so good for Samsung. The company was in the spotlight once again, smartphones were cool once again (after a year where global smartphone sales had been sliding), and Samsung was looking like the industry design and engineering leader - after years of being pegged as an iPhone copycat . Then the Galaxy Fold review units went out. Within a day, the reports of broken displays began to arrive. The Verge's Dieter Bohn reported his review unit's folding display developed a bulge then its OLED display failed after just one day of use . Bloomberg's Mark Gurman posted that his Galaxy Fold was "" completely broken and unusable just two days in. "" Again it was a failure of the folding display. CNBC's review attempt ended when the Galaxy Fold they were given was "" completely unusable after just two days of use. "" And there were more. It's possible the reviewers all received phones from an initial batch that suffered a manufacturing defect. It's also possible that Samsung's folding screen design is flawed and not ready for prime time. Samsung issued a terse statement to The Verge : ""A limited number of early Galaxy Fold samples were provided to media for review. We have received a few reports regarding the main display on the samples provided. We will thoroughly inspect these units in person to determine the cause of the matter. Separately, a few reviewers reported having removed the top layer of the display causing damage to the screen. The main display on the Galaxy Fold features a top protective layer, which is part of the display structure designed to protect the screen from unintended scratches. Removing the protective layer or adding adhesives to the main display may cause damage. We will ensure this information is clearly delivered to our customers.""  Company representatives also told The Verge they plan to continue with the Galaxy Fold's April 26 U.S. launch. For Samsung, this is bad news. Comparisons have already been made to the Galaxy Note 7 disaster of 2016 that decimated the company's smartphone profits and allowed Apple to surpass Samsung as the world's top-selling smartphone maker - at least for one quarter . It's not on the same level in the sense that the Galaxy Fold screen break isn't a safety issue, but at $1,980 a pop and with pre-orders selling out almost immediately , the company is facing a big PR issue and the possibility of a release delay (or a recall if it goes ahead as planned) while it investigates what's going wrong. For Apple, the very public and very rapid failure of multiple Galaxy Fold review units is nothing but good news. Apple stock has been under pressure from slowing iPhone sales. And with rivals like Samsung and Huawei showing off radical new folding smartphone flagships this year, AAPL's iPhones were looking far from exciting. If the initial Galaxy Fold failures develop into a full-scale debacle, the lack of its own folding smartphone at this time will turn from Apple falling behind , to Apple avoiding gimmicks and sticking with solid, proven engineering. Incremental design updates may be boring, but quality and reliability is something that Apple can leverage as it works to boost iPhone sales. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

The agreement effectively ends a long-running conflict between   YouTube and Amazon, which began all the way back in late 2015,   when Amazon stopped selling Google's Chromecast streaming adapter   on its web store. At the time, Amazon justified the move with the   argument that its own video services weren't available on   Chromecast. However, Google countered that it was Amazon's choice   to withhold its service from the device. The conflict intensified when Amazon released its Echo Show   smart display device in 2017. The device initially featured a   customized YouTube integration, which   Google quickly blocked    . Amazon developed a work-around for that block, which Google   promptly disabled as well. At the time, Google further escalated   the conflict, and also   began blocking YouTube on Amazon's Fire TV   devices.  Amazon eventually instituted another work-around that is based   on simply launching a YouTube web interface on a TV-optimized   browser.

In December, the two companies signaled that they were close   to a break-through, and   Amazon actually began stocking Google's   Chromecast again.  It's worth noting that this week's agreement doesn't include a   native YouTube app for the Echo Show.   Variety    has been told that this isn't actually due to commercial   disagreements - YouTube simply hasn't built a full-featured app   for these kinds of devices yet. The YouTube integration on the   company's own Google Home Hub display is instead based on   Google's Chromecast technology.

22,"iStock The electric bus revolution is about to take off. While the prospect of major advances in electric buses receive a small fraction of the attention that electric vehicles receive, the potential for a major transformation is arguably much closer. As with EVs, electric buses promise lower life-cycle costs when compared to their gasoline and diesel counterparts, but upfront costs remain painfully high. However, Proterra, an electric bus manufacturer, is rolling out leasing plans that could eliminate this barrier. Proterra and Mitsui & Co. are teaming up to lease the batteries in electric buses so that the upfront costs of an electric bus reaches parity with a traditional diesel bus. In other words, no upfront cost for the battery, just monthly lease payments over the lifespan of the vehicle. The monthly payments would be offset by the fuel savings. It is the same approach that solar developers began using years ago: no upfront cost, just lease payments over time. A 2018 analysis from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) predicted that while EVs would capture nearly a third of the total auto market by the 2030 – a bold prediction, to be sure – electric buses would gain acceptance must faster. By 2030, electric buses overwhelm the bus market, taking 84 percent of total sales. In one scenario, BNEF sees electric buses reaching upfront cost parity with conventional buses on an unsubsidized basis by the mid-2020s. The CEO of Proterra told Axios in a March interview that he doesn’t actually see electric buses ever reaching cost parity with diesel buses, but not for the reasons one might think. “I don’t think we’ll ever get all the way there, because I actually think that once we’re within a 2-year fuel payback, the diesel bus market goes extinct,” Proterra’s chief executive Ryan Popple said. Still, the steeper upfront cost today is one of the largest hurdles. Mitsui has agreed to provide a $200 million credit facility to help launch Proterra’s battery leasing program. A new diesel bus can cost about $500,000 while also incurring around $1 million in maintenance and fuel costs over its lifetime, according to Proterra’s Ryan Popple and Greentech Media. In contrast, one of Proterra’s electric buses costs $750,000 upfront, but will have maintenance costs that are 20 percent lower than a diesel bus. By adding in a lease for the battery, the electric bus can make sense right away, rather than having a long payback period. “On a percent basis, it takes the upfront premium for an electric bus from 50 percent to zero,” Popple told Greentech Media. “You eliminate $250,000 of capital acquisition premium that you traditionally paid to invest in a higher-efficiency electric bus.” Electric buses may have an easier time gaining traction than passenger EVs for several reasons. They drive longer distances, which means the fuel savings add up over a shorter period of time. They cover predictable routes, making it easier to locate and build recharging infrastructure. Perhaps most importantly, the customers tend to be municipalities or corporations, rather than individuals. These entities can take a long-term view, and make practical decisions around life-cycle costs. China accounts for the vast majority of electric buses on the roads worldwide. The U.S. market is still small, although growing quickly. As of 2017, fewer than 500 electric buses were sold in the U.S. But Proterra told Greentech Media that demand is strong and it already has 45 new orders this year, including from repeat customers. Portland, Oregon, just deployed its first electric bus this week, a bus manufactured by Winnipeg-based New Flyer. Portland has plan to switch its nearly 700-bus fleet from diesel to electric by 2040. More and more cities are opting to do the same. The impact on the oil market could be more profound from buses than from EVs, at least in the short- and medium-term. According to BNEF, electric buses (again, mostly in China) will displace about 270,000 barrels of diesel demand per day in 2019, while EVs will only displace a little more than 80,000 bpd of gasoline and diesel demand. Elon Musk and Tesla tend to soak up an inordinate share of media attention when it comes to electrifying the transportation sector, but e-buses are having a larger impact.

The company will begin to   test Top 10 lists of the most popular content across multiple   categories in the U.K. this quarter, executives revealed in their   letter to shareholders    on Tuesday. The test is part of an effort to become more   transparent with the company's audience as well as producers   about viewing trends. ""For those who want to watch what others are watching, this   may make choosing titles even easier,"" they explained in the   shareholder letter. ""After a few months we'll decide whether to   end or expand the test.""  Netflix    chief product officer Greg Peters said during the company's       earnings call    Tuesday afternoon that the test was one of hundreds the company   was doing per quarter, adding on an upbeat note: ""We are quite   bullish on that, and we'll see how it does.""makeArticleAd(); Netflix announced this new test as part of its earnings   release for Q1 of 2019. During the quarter, the   company added 9.6 million new subscribers    - more than ever before. Investors nonetheless sent the company's   stock price down due to a weaker-than-anticipated Q2   forecast. Executives also used the shareholder letter to once again   selectively highlight the performance of some of its biggest   titles. ""   The Umbrella Academy    ,"" which premiered on Netflix on Feb. 15, has been watched by 45   million member households in the first four weeks following its   release; ""      Triple Frontier    ,"" a movie starring Ben Affleck that went live on Netflix on   March 13, has been watched by over 52 million member households   in its first four weeks on the service. ""The Highwaymen,"" which stars Kevin Costner and Woody   Harrelson, is on track to being watched by over 40 million member   households in its first month, according to Netflix. The   company's Fyre Festival doc has been viewed by more than 20   million households in its first month, and the nature documentary   series ""Our Planet"" is on track to attract over 25 million viewer   households in its first month, Netflix said. Netflix's selective release of these data points, as well as   its test of viewer charts, stands in stark contrast to the   company's aversion to data sharing in the past. Up until   recently, Netflix executives regularly argued that they didn't   need to share any viewership data with anyone, simply because   Netflix was not an ad-supported service that relied on ratings to   attract brands. But on Tuesday, chief content officer Ted Sarandos said that   this was about to change. ""Over the next several months, we are   going to be rolling out more specific, granular reporting,""   Sarandos said. ""First to our producers, and then to our members,   and be more fully transparent about what people are watching on   Netflix around the world."" The new trend to selectively share data can be explained as a   way to assure investors that Netflix's originals strategy is   working, even as other studios are moving their franchises to   their own services. ""   The Umbrella Academy    ,"" for instance, has been touted as a way for Netflix to replace   its Marvel shows, many of which it canceled last year. Likewise,   sharing audience data for movies can be seen as a way to show the   markets that expensive tentpole titles can attract sizable   audiences. But with the introduction of Top 10 lists, Netflix is also   looking to further use the momentum of some of its   best-performing titles to keep its audience engaged, and help   them decide on what to watch next. That again is a bit of a   departure for the company, which has in the past relied on   hyper-personalized curation. For instance, Netflix is even   showing different preview images for the same movie to different   viewers to optimize their performance among distinct segments of   its audience. Sarandos used the company's earnings call Tuesday afternoon to   highlight another reason the company may be using Top 10 lists   going forward: As the company increases its investments in   originals, these success stories also become branding exercises.   "" Our top ten most-watched shows on Netflix, they're all Netflix   original brands,"" Sarandos said.

35," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may be having issues with iPhone sales and an underwhelming response to new services like Apple News+ and Apple TV+, but the company is doing quite well with its AirPods. However, that success - and the rapidly growing wireless earbud market - is bringing out competitors. The latest tech giant to be making a play for the AirPods' market is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which is reportedly working on what may end up being named ""Surface Buds.""  Consumer demand for wireless earbuds has been growing, helped by the trend started by Apple of eliminating the headphone jack in smartphones. It's expected to hit $10 billion by 2023 . That being said, the big upside for Microsoft stock isn't just the potential revenue in play by selling Surface Buds, it's also something much bigger. Thurrott , a website known for breaking MSFT product news, is reporting that the company is currently working on a new product with the code-name ""Morrison. "" According to Thurrott's multiple un-named sources, Morrison is a set of wireless earbuds that may end up being called Surface Buds when released (potentially in 2019). They are expected to have Cortana onboard, and could incorporate advanced capabilities like noise cancellation and tech that's described as a way to ""improve interactions between a phone and the earbuds to make reading content easier on the phone."" Whatever that last feature actually is (and whether it makes it into the production version), the core concept should sound pretty familiar by now: The so-called Surface Buds are aimed squarely at Apple's AirPods. If the idea of MSFT making earbuds seems farfetched, remember that last fall the company launched Surface Headphones . These are premium priced ($349.99) wireless headphones with active noise cancellation, touch controls and - most importantly - Cortana on board. That's where the real upside for Microsoft stock lies, the Cortana integration. When Apple introduced the AirPods alongside the iPhone X in 2017, the bizarre-looking wireless earbuds were widely mocked. It didn't take long before traditional earbud manufacturers realized their mistake, though. AirPods were a surprise success and demand went through the roof. AirPods currently hold 60% of the global market for true wireless earbuds , and in March the company released its second generation version with hands-free Siri. And it's Siri that has caught the attention of the big tech competitors like MSFT. These companies realize that Apple is following the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) playbook, sneaking Siri into a popular product category the way AMZN added Alexa to a wireless speaker with the Echo. They've seen how that's played out, with the explosion in smart speaker popularity driving up Alexa's popularity - despite the fact that Amazon has no horse in the smartphone race.  Since the AirPods were first announced, we've seen Pixel Buds (with Google Assistant onboard) from Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google and Galaxy Buds from Samsung with Samsung's Bixby voice assistant baked in. Amazon is reportedly working on Alexa wireless earbuds , in a move that could extend its reach to the smartphone. Microsoft releasing Surface Buds would follow that same pattern and the move would offer the same prize that Amazon is shooting for. With Microsoft's own smartphone ambitions shattered - on both the hardware and Windows front - selling consumers a set of Surface Buds is a way to get Cortana into use on smartphones. Getting Cortana into more widespread adoption has huge advantages for MSFT. With machine learning, the more a voice assistant is used, the smarter it gets. The more popular it is, the higher the likelihood third-party electronics manufacturers will offer support in their products, such as smart home devices. Cortana uses Microsoft's Bing search engine by default, and that opens the door for ad and search placement revenue potential ( paid Bing search netted MSFT $1.8 billion in 2017 ) when Surface Bud owners start asking for things like nearby restaurants or movie recommendations. Surface Buds may sound like a niche product, but they're MSFT's play to regain a mobile foothold - with billions of smartphones potentially in play. If the company can convince consumers that Surface Buds are superior to AirPods or Pixel Buds, Cortana adoption has a chance to grow. Added to the revenue hardware from selling the earbuds, that would be good news for Microsoft stock. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

37,"Shutterstock photo To what extent can Netflix (NFLX) fight off threats from emerging streaming platforms from media titans Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA) asset NBCUniversal? Netflix is set to report first quarter fiscal 2019 financial results Tuesday after the closing bell. As is often the case, Netflix’s Q1 results will be the first among its FAANG peers — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG , GOOGL), to be released and could set the tone for what the group is expected to do. For Netflix, however, the company will be asked to respond amid the recent unveiling of Disney’s streaming platform. Disney last week finally announced details about its upcoming streaming service, dubbed Disney+. The service, which will cost $6.99 per month, or $69.99 for an annual plan, is expected to be ready on Nov. 12, delivering a combination of original content and offerings from Disney's extensive libraries as well as content it now owns via its Fox acquisition. Analysts remain positive that Netflix’s first-mover advantage won’t disrupt its long-term growth story. This is especially after Netflix has recently raised prices for its subscriptions in the U.S., raising the price of both its basic and standard plans by $1, while its premium offering was increased by $2. Netflix believes it has made the necessary investments in original content (both movies and TV shows) to maintain its status the streaming movie leader. On Tuesday it can allay competitive concerns by delivering solid subscriber additions for both domestic and international markets and upbeat guidance. For the quarter that ended March, Wall Street expects Netflix to earn 57 cents per share on revenue of $4.5 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were 64 cents per share on $3.7 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, earnings are projected to rise 51% to $4.05 per share, while full-year revenue of $20.21 billion would mark an increase of 28% year over year. Netflix shares have risen more than 30% year to date, despite expectations of a conservative quarter. This is because the company added 30 million net new subscribers in 2018, thanks to its international push, and it is expected to add at least another 30 million this year. For the just-ended quarter, Wall Street expects the company to add global subscriber additions of 8.94 billion. And it is expected to outline plans to secure and maintain its massive slice of that market. The good news is the rapidly growing movie streaming market is expected to gain steam in the years ahead, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 20% from 2018 to 2025 and reach $124.57 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research. This is especially notable since average revenue per user is expected to rise from $91.37 in 2019 to $98.64 by 2023, according to Statista. All told, the company’s aggressive investment in original content is paying off as evidenced by its projected growth rate and the fact that it has begun to see increased competition, which further solidifies its working business model. Combined with its recent price hike, which will be used to fund its multibillion-dollar original content plans, Netflix it assured to remain a dominant platform despite these emerging new threats.",Richard Saintvilus,"April 16, 2019, 08:17:07 AM EDT",Netflix (NFLX) 1st Quarter Earnings: What to Expect
38,"Logitech    has a new plan to simplify the clutter of streaming devices in   your living room: The company has built a universal remote dubbed   the Harmony Express that relies on voice control to switch   between streaming devices connected to your TV, launch apps and   flip channels. To supercharge its new voice remote, the company   has teamed up with Amazon, and directly integrated the company's   Alexa    assistant.  Logitech    has been making universal remote controls under the Harmony brand   for nearly 2 decades. Some of the company's devices have been   traditional universal remote controls with lots of buttons to   control a multitude of devices, while others have incorporated   touch screens. For the Harmony Express, the company ditched the screen, and   reduced the number of buttons down to the essentials. All of this   is being replaced by an internal microphone, which can be   triggered with the press of a button, and a small speaker. The   idea of the latter is not to add yet another Echo to your house -   it sounds worse than your average phone speaker, so you won't   want to listen to music on it anyway - but get quick voice   feedback.makeArticleAd(); The remote uses a combination of infrared, Bluetooth,   Bluetooth LE and Wifi to control devices, and comes with a IR   blaster puck as well as an IR extender to reach TVs and other   living room devices. The remote itself is rechargeable via micro   USB, and is supposed to last for a month or longer between   charges. Harmony Express is available effective immediately   online for $249.99, and is supposed to come to Best Buy stores   soon. The Harmony Express setup is done via a mobile companion app,   which identifies streaming devices on the same Wifi network, and   makes it easy to allocate them to HDMI ports on your TV. Cable   boxes, A/V receivers and other accessories can be added manually   as well. Users can decide which device they want to use for which   streaming app, and then simply say things like ""Go to Netflix,""   ""turn on Fire TV"" or ""go to NBC"" to switch devices, apps and   channels. The Harmony Express does not yet know which shows run on which   apps, so you won't be able to search for content across your   devices. The company plans to add this functionality at a later   point; Fire TV users can actually get a glimpse of such universal   search, thanks to the remote's deep integration with   Alexa    , which powers voice search on Amazon's streaming devices. During a demo given by Logitech staff, the remote performed   flawlessly, switching back and forth between a smart TV   interface, a game console, streaming devices and a old-school   Comcast Xfinity cable box. However, briefly tested under   real-life conditions, the Harmony Express didn't always do so   well. The remote wasn't always able to find the right HDMI inputs   on an older TV, frequently ending up on the wrong device. Moved to a different TV set, the device performed more   reliably, but still revealed a number of quirks. While the   Harmony Express knows a number of standard apps, it can quickly   stumble with others. Asked about launching the Roku Channel,   Alexa simply responds ""I couldn't find that channel."" Tasked to   switch to the ABC news app, the remote instead suggested to add   ABC News to Alexa's audio-only news briefing. Even more   perplexing were instances when Logitech's nomenclature clearly   collided with Alexa's. Here's one of the more perplexing   dialogues: ""Go to Prime Video.""    ""I can't do that on Harmony Express.""     ""Go to Amazon Video.""    ""Getting Prime Video from Harmony Express.""  Even when asking for the exact names for apps assigned via the   Express companion mobile app, like ""iTunes TV Shows,"" the remote   would sometimes respond: ""Here is what I found: Harmony Express   doesn't support that."" There were also some other quirks specific to the test set-up.   The Harmony Express remote is supposed to allow channel surfing   while watching live TV, but none of the buttons worked out of the   box to flip channels, which made it necessary to manually   reprogram a button. Launching apps on Fire TV was a bit of a hit   or miss as well. And finally, the remote doesn't seem to support   the launching of apps on the Nvidia Shield Android TV streamer at   all. The bottom line is that building a universal remote for the   streaming age isn't easy. Others have tried with different   approaches.   Amazon built its own device control into the Fire   TV Cube    , which isn't really meant to launch apps on other streamers.   Caavo built its own remote complete with a HDMI   switch    that uses complicated image recognition technology to identify   apps on connected devices - an approach that can be painfully   slow, and adds unnecessary layers between users and their   devices. Logitech's approach seems make the most sense - but its   failings also show that devices that try to be smart can still at   times look pretty dumb. For some consumers, that may be a   trade-off worth taking. Others may decide to instead just stick   with an extra remote or two on their coffee table.

39," Following its 2017 release of the ""Star Wars: Jedi Challenges"" augmented reality ( AR ) headset, Lenovo and Disney seem to be preparing the release of hardware related to yet another blockbuster franchise: A new FCC filing suggests that the companies are getting close to unveil a Marvel -themed AR headset. The heavily-redacted filing describes controllers for a ""Mirage 1.5"" device, suggesting that it is part of Lenovo 's immersive media hardware (the company's Daydream VR headset, 180-degree camera and ""Star Wars"" AR headset were all marketed under the Mirage branding). A document included in the filing further mentions a ""standalone Marvel controller"" as well as a ""Marvel package."" What's more, the controller for the ""Star Wars"" headset used the model number AAC151B. The controller in the new filing is numbered AAC161B. Spokespeople for Lenovo and Marvel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Lenovo's ""Star Wars: Jedi Challenges"" combined a head-mounted display (pictured above) with a user's cell phone to super-impose images of ""Star Wars"" characters over the physical world. The device shipped with two light saber controllers, giving consumers a chance to battle Darth Vader, Kylo Ren and others. Originally priced $200, the headset now retails for $79. At launch in late 2017, Disney advanced development VP Mike Goslin already suggested that the two companies may eventually bring other Disney franchises to the headset as well.  In fact, the original headset already included buttons not necessary to play the ""Star Wars"" AR games. The new FCC filings suggest that Lenovo may simply be selling Marvel-themed controllers to anyone who already owns ""Star Wars: Jedi Challenges,"" allowing them to play games for both franchises with the same headset. In addition, Lenovo is likely going to sell a bundle with the headset and 2 controllers.

42," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips When Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) held its special event in March, the company's new Apple+ video streaming service was clearly front and center. According to a report released over the weekend, another of the AAPL subscription service announced at that event is seeing a huge investment from the company, with analysts predicting it will eclipse Apple TV+ revenue. Apple Arcade may not have been in the same spotlight that Apple TV+ enjoyed, but it could prove to be the new release with a bigger impact on Apple stock.  On March 25, Apple held its first special event of 2019 , and as expected, its Apple TV+ video streaming service was the star of the show. The company is spending upward of a billion dollars on original content for Apple TV+ this year, making it a very big bet. Also announced at the March event was Apple Arcade. AAPL's new video game subscription service is coming this fall, and it is promised to have 100 or more exclusive game titles at launch. The intent of the video game subscription service appears to be to further monetize the App Store's long-held lead in mobile gaming, and to appeal to gamers who are tired of free-to-play titles with endless in-app purchases required. Apple Arcade got less attention. Not only because AAPL kept the spotlight on Apple TV+, but also because Apple Arcade seemed like a half-baked concept (will iPhone owners actually pay for games?), and pricing details were not released. It will also be going up against other new subscription-based gaming services when it launches, including the much more heavily hyped Stadia from Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google. A report over the weekend from the Financial Times (via AppleInsider ) suggests Apple Arcade is a much bigger initiative than it seemed on the surface. The $1 billion the company is investing in original programming for Apple TV+, which is seen as a big deal, but according to the Financial Times report, AAPL is also spending $500 million to ensure Apple Arcade has a full slate of exclusive games at launch. The level of investment in the service wasn't really clear from the original announcement and it suggests Apple is serious about its new gaming service. The report also says AAPL is offering incentives to game publishers - spending more money - to ensure their titles have a window of exclusivity on Apple Arcade, and will continue doing so beyond the service's launch. Also included in the Financial Times report were predictions from HSBC analysts. Apple didn't release pricing for Apple Arcade, but the HSBC analysts are predicting it will cost $12.99 per month. At that price, they are estimating that by 2024, Apple Arcade could have 29 million subscribers and bring in $4.5 billion in annual revenue. In comparison, they see Apple TV+ generating $4.1 billion in annual revenue by 2024, while the Apple News+ news and subscription service hit $2.7 billion. In other words, Apple Arcade is being seen as the bigger win - despite the higher spending on Apple TV+ and the much higher level of media and public attention on the video streaming service. With softening iPhone sales, the company's Services division is increasingly important and subscriptions are seen as a key way to leverage the billion+ Apple devices already out there. AAPL sees Services revenue as being critical to boosting revenue and driving Apple stock's value. And it's possible that Apple Arcade may turn out to be the real star of that Services division.

44,"Facing a backlash over overzealous copyright enforcement,   Starz    issued an apology on Monday for inadvertently taking down tweets   to articles about TV show piracy. The TV network said in a   statement that it recently incurred a security breach, which   prompted the company to hire a third party for copyright   enforcement. ""The techniques and technologies employed in these efforts are   not always perfect, and as such it appears that in this case,   some posts were inadvertently caught up in the sweep that may   fall outside the   DMCA    guidelines,"" the network said in a statement. ""That was never our intention and we apologize to those who   were incorrectly targeted. We are in the process of reviewing all   of the impacted posts as well as the scope and procedure for the   previous takedowns and are working with our vendors to reinstate   any such content that was inappropriately targeted for   removal.""makeArticleAd(); The apology came in response to a series of takedowns that   started last week.      Torrentfreak    , a long-established website reporting on P2P and piracy,   ran a story    about a new flood of TV show leaks. The story mentioned that   unreleased episodes from a number of shows, including   Starz    titles like ""American Gods,"" had appeared on piracy sites. Torrentfreak didn't link to any leaked episodes, or even   mention the sites that were hosting those leaks. The site did   identify a New York-based magazine editor as a possible source of   the leaks, and also included a handful of screenshots in its   reporting. After Torrentfreak first published the story, Starz used a   social media agency to have Twitter take down tweets to the   story. Torrentfreak protested, and   wrote a follow-up article    about the takedowns - and promptly had tweets to that story taken   down as well.

Related stories  Boom in TV Period Dramas Raises Demand for       History Consultants   FilMart: Jim Packer Says Liongate Ready to       Support Starz Global Rollout Facing a backlash over overzealous copyright enforcement,   Starz    issued an apology on Monday for inadvertently taking down tweets   to articles about TV show piracy. The TV network said in a   statement that it recently incurred a security breach, which   prompted the company to hire a third party for copyright   enforcement. ""The techniques and technologies employed in these efforts are   not always perfect, and as such it appears that in this case,   some posts were inadvertently caught up in the sweep that may   fall outside the   DMCA    guidelines,"" the network said in a statement. ""That was never our intention and we apologize to those who   were incorrectly targeted. We are in the process of reviewing all   of the impacted posts as well as the scope and procedure for the   previous takedowns and are working with our vendors to reinstate   any such content that was inappropriately targeted for   removal."" The apology came in response to a series of takedowns that   started last week.      Torrentfreak    , a long-established website reporting on P2P and piracy,   ran a story    about a new flood of TV show leaks. The story mentioned that   unreleased episodes from a number of shows, including   Starz    titles like ""American Gods,"" had appeared on piracy sites. Torrentfreak didn't link to any leaked episodes, or even   mention the sites that were hosting those leaks. The site did   identify a New York-based magazine editor as a possible source of   the leaks, and also included a handful of screenshots in its   reporting. After Torrentfreak first published the story, Starz used a   social media agency to have Twitter take down tweets to the   story. Torrentfreak protested, and   wrote a follow-up article    about the takedowns - and promptly had tweets to that story taken   down as well. The tweet takedowns have been widely criticized, with the   Electronic Frontier Foundation and others coming to   Torrentfreak's support.

46,"The FAANG stocks aren’t the only place to find action in the tech sector. So far, tech growth is back on track after swooning in the 2H18. The Nasdaq index is up 19% since 2019 trading started on January 2. While the FAANG stocks get most of the headlines for pushing those gains, some of that impetus is coming from smaller firms. There is plenty of growth to go around, and mid-sized companies are cashing in. From an investor’s perspective, growth is not their only advantage; where the tech giants mostly have a very high entry point, stocks in mid-cap companies are generally much more affordable per share. Here we’ll take a look at three of those tech companies to see what they have in common and why the market likes them, and using the TipRanks analyst database as our guide. TipRanks analyzes the best Wall Street analysts, rating them by the success of their stock reviews. Fidelity National Information Services (FIS – Research Report) Fintech – the link-up between the financial and technological services sectors – is a hot topic these days. Encompassing everything from payment processing to banking software to online trading, fintech includes services for institutions, corporate customers, and Joe Average. If you just did your taxes on your home computer, you’ve used fintech. Fidelity National Information Services, or FIS as it is better known, specializes in software and payment processing services, for institutional clients in retail and investment banking. It’s a lucrative niche, and FIS is reaping the reward; the company is up 12% year to date. Another indicator of FIS’ success in the field is its announcement, last month, that it will acquire UK-based Worldpay for $35 billion. The move is part of a trend toward consolidation in the online payment processing sector, but is also seen as a measure of strength on the part of FIS. Wall Street’s analysts like what they are seeing. Raymond James’ John Davis (Track Record & Ratings), in an April 12 note, says that he believes “the Street underappreciates the strategic value of the recently announced Worldpay acquisition.” Davis goes on to enumerate three key advantages of the deal: “1) the fact that this deal accelerates WP's entrance into new, fast growing markets (i.e., Brazil and India), 2) the ability to leverage the NYCE debit network across WP's merchant base in the U.S., and 3) the natural fit between FIS and WP's Issuing businesses.” Davis sets a $131 price target on FIS shares, indicating up to 13% upside for the stock.  Earlier this month, Joseph Foresi (Track Record & Ratings) of Cantor Fitzgerald, currently rated #1 in TipRanks’ database, compared recent fundamental and technical analyses of FIS, and saw potential for continued growth. He wrote, “Fundamentally, we believe the company has the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth, improve margins and deleverage, which should have a positive impact on results and multiples. Technically, FIS recently broke out of its sideways channel.” Foresi’s price target of $122, while more conservative than Davis’ above, still gives FIS nearly 8% of upside potential. Overall, FIS’s Strong Buy consensus is based on 7 buy reviews and 1 hold, given over the past three months by the best performing analysts. The company’s $128 average price target indicates 13% upside for the shares. FIS currently sells for $113.  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A – Research Report) Agilent, which spun-off of Hewlett-Packard in 1999, produces analytical software, instruments, and services for laboratories in the chemical and biological industries. In short, Agilent provides the gear and software that scientists need to do their work. As with FIS this niche is a growth industry, and Agilent shares are up 23% this year. Company’s management is not reticent about meeting with investors and analysts. Cowen’s Doug Schenkel (Track Record & Ratings) said that, after such a meeting, he “came away from the meetings with incremental confidence in the company's ability to continue posting above-peer average top and bottom-line growth in the near- and long-term. He believes shares are worth $90 and could see further upside as management continues to execute relative to expectations.” That $90 price target suggests another 11% upside for Agilent. Writing from UBS, analyst Daniel Brennan (Track Record & Ratings) initiated coverage of Agilent on March 15. In is opening note, Brennan said, “Stronger revenue growth coupled with rising incremental margins support earnings forecasts being 2%-3% ahead of consensus.” His price target, $92, indicates an upside of 13%. A’s shares are currently trading for $80, so the average price target of $86 would suggest an upside of 7%. The stock holds a consensus rating of Strong Buy, based on a unanimous 7 buys given in the last three months.  Keysight Technologies, Inc. (KEYS – Research Report) Where Agilent spun off from Hewlett-Packard, Keysight spun off from Agilent. The company branched out on its own in 2014, and has never looked back. Keysight is up 49% so far this year, capping off gains of 225% over the last five years. Those gains are built, like Agilent’s, on lab equipment. Keysight produces software and hardware for electronics and radio analysis and measurement. Multimeters, oscilloscopes, signal generators, in-circuit testers – Keysight produces a range of tools that you possibly have heard of, may even have seen, and almost certainly makes the tech in your life actually work.  Fast growth has gotten the notice of top-rated analysts. Jefferies analyst Brandon Couillard (Track Rating & Ratings) is currently rated #17 overall – out of more than 5,000 – by TipRanks. He looks at this company and says, “Keysight is very well positioned to benefit from multiple big growth areas that remain in the early innings, namely 5G, connected cars, aerospace and defense spend, and Internet of things. With its fiscal 2019 earnings per share rising to $4.00, Keysight has basically already reached its fiscal 2021 target just 12 months since putting it out.” Couillard’s $100 price target suggests a nearly 9% upside to the stock. Couillard is not the only analyst to give Keysight high marks. Earlier this month, John Marchetti (Track Record & Ratings), writing from Stifel, gave his price target on Keysight a 15% bump, moving it from $87 to $100. It was another vote of confidence for this fast-growing company. Keysight is our third Strong Buy consensus today, with its rating based on 4 buy reviews. KEYS shares have an average price target of $97, which implies an upside of 6% when compared to the current share price of $91.

52," “A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself. Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people.” ~ Franklin D. Roosevelt Forests are often dubbed as the ‘lungs of our planet’ and this defines how important they are for us. Yet over the years, the earth’s forest cover has declined at an alarming rate. Around 18.7 million acres of forest are lost annually which is equivalent to 27 soccer fields every minute. There are a number of reasons for it. While efforts have been made by conservationists, institutions and governments to combat deforestation, they have fallen short and problems still persist. In an era when advanced technologies (such as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence) are becoming a part of varied industries, there is increasing evidence of how these technologies can contribute towards solving globally pressing issues such as deforestation. Here’s how. Today, approximately 31 percent of the earth’s land surface is covered by forests which is equivalent to about 4 billion hectares of land. This is much lower than the pre-industrial area of 5.9 billion hectares. The main behind the decline in the green cover over the years are logging (legal and illegal), agricultural expansion, mining, urbanization and infrastructure expansion (such as roads). Illegal logging is one of the prime factors causing deforestation. The economic value of illegal logging around the world (including processing) is estimated between $30 and $100 billion according to the UN Environment Programme. According to WWF, illegal logging happens at a rate of approximately 80 percent in Peru while that in Myanmar is 85 percent and nearly 65 percent in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In addition to logging, mining activities have been causing huge damage: approximately 10 percent of the deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon between 2005 and 2015 was due to mining activities. Given the interlinkages and the delicate balance which forests maintain, the fallouts of deforestation are severe. Our forests are called the water fountains as three-quarters of the globe’s accessible freshwater comes from forested watersheds. Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports that 40 percent of the world’s 230 major watersheds have lost more than half of their original tree cover. The Paris Climate Agreement acknowledges the crucial role of forests and trees in maintaining the earth’s temperature. The green lungs absorb (equivalent to) 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. As the second-leading cause of climate change, deforestation accounts for nearly 20 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions — more than the world’s entire transport sector as per a report by the FAO. This is grave. “Although the pace of global deforestation has slowed since the 1990s, it remains high with about 13 million hectares (gross) lost each year. This is partially offset by reforestation, making the total annual net forest cover loss 5.6 million hectares” reads a World bank report. Advanced technologies such as AI and big data are being leveraged in the fight against deforestation. SilviaTerra is using AI to monitor forests. SilviaTerra has a software-based approach to solve forest inventory problems by assessing forests using satellite imagery and machine learning. The algorithm, powered by AI, is enabling precision forestry at a fraction of time, fieldwork and cost of conventional methods. SilviaTerra aims to build an up-to-date map of U.S. forests with detailed information about each tree. To do so, they are using Microsoft Azure (MSFT), high-resolution satellite imagery, and U.S. Forest Service inventory and analysis field data to train machine-learning models to measure forests. By analyzing forest sounds, Rainforest Connection (RFCx), a non-government organization “aims to use cell phones to stop deforestation.” The Rainforest Connection (RFCx) has built acoustic monitoring systems to protect a rainforest area by responding to real-time alerts while enhancing protections in these areas. RFCx uses TensorFlow, Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) machine learning framework, “to analyze all the auditory data in real-time and listen for chainsaws, logging trucks and other sounds of illegal activity to pinpoint problems in the forest.” 20tree.ai is combining AI and satellite imagery powered by NVIDIA’s (NVDA) computing power to gain information into forest composition like tree species, tree height and diameter (DBH), tree growth and productivity. The forest management system by 20tree.ai allows for the monitoring of entire forests in a fraction of the time while providing near real-time intelligence into forest and wood inventory. The system is used by locals, NGO’s, corporates and governments to get actionable insights about deforestation, drought, insect plagues, soil health, storm damage, and other forest disturbances. Overall, advanced technologies such as AI and analytics have made the processing of data (collected through sensors, cameras, satellite images, drones, among other sources) faster, cost-effective, and accurate.

You cannot have access to the Medallion Fund’s Technology but you can have access to Trade-Ideas, LLC and their AI system called “Holly.” Holly is the only commercially available AI service that has delivered positive alpha over the past three years. Trade-Ideas has recently been awarded Best Machine Learning Development at FundIntelligence’s 2019 Technology and WSL Awards. This was mostly due to the proven application of the technology to substantially outperform the S&P in 2018. Holly is an artificial intelligence tool that generates active strategies each day to capture alpha. Different modes of application are available: Risk-on performance reflects a bias towards staying in the positions beyond reward targets while strictly adhering to risk targets for each trade. Risk-off mode is where reward actions do not deviate from trade plan parameters and risk management rules permitting exits earlier if existing profits erode significantly. Risk-on mode carries all trades the entire day until the close and is often present during days of momentum which typify the majority of trading days in 2018.  Some 2018 Risk-On performance metrics follow: Investors, advisors, traders and hedge fund managers are becoming aware of Trade-Ideas, LLC which ranks number 3,012 on the 2018 INC 5000 with three year sales growth of 134%. My intent in writing this series of articles is to bring ideas and managers I may find that may have an advantage for us, the smaller independent investment advisor or more sophisticated individual investors. Today, I am focused on Trade-Ideas LLC. This is a service I have been using over the past year. Most of my 50-year career has been focused on active equity management.  I have used a number of computer based tools to help me deliver positive alpha.  Nothing I have used in the past has compared to the tools Trade-Ideas has made available to me, a professional investor. Towards full disclosure, know that I have become an affiliate and plan to consult with other professionals in the use of “Holly.” Why consulting on this AI system? To draw an analogy, I have been an instrument pilot and instructor for a number of years.  Often pilots with a great deal of experience ask me to instruct them to fly a light sport aircraft.  My student needs to be humble and learn all over again because this type of airplane is more difficult to fly in certain circumstances. Using AI from Trade-Ideas requires a new learning process as well.  I am an advocate of Trade-Ideas for advisors and I recognize some of the skills they need to acquire and the habits they need to unlearn.  These new tools have great potential to increase the level of profits we normally expect while lowering risks.  These tools have become valuable in this new age of low cost commissions and fast electronic trading. I have recently interviewed Dan Mirkin, Senior Managing Partner and CEO of Trade-Ideas, LLC and have asked him the following questions: How did you get involved with this business? Dan:  After I graduated from the University of Texas, I became involved with SOES Trading.  I found I could earn as much as a real job and manage my time as I chose.  Later I became a hedge fund manager actively trading index derivatives.  This led to becoming involved in the direct access trading technology business.  I contributed to the design and testing of Cybertraders, the first commercially viable direct access trading program which was acquired by Schwab for $400 million dollars in 2000. As trading costs continued to go lower and brokerage firms like E-Trade brought access to independent investors, my career continued to evolve in the direction of Trade-Ideas. How did your process evolve? Dan: After years of experience working with venture partners and getting a $50 million dollar education, it was by catering mainly to professional traders, active traders and hedge funds that we began to build a reputation. Today our technology accomplishes what no human can do and that is to watch each and every trade of every stock in the markets and alert our clients about profitable activity so they can act first. We make the computers in our data centers act like traders by playing thousands of trading scenarios each day. Much like IBM’s Watson, our computers are continually learning which market relationships have predictive outcomes. Our servers identify what is working in a declining or rising market and suggest exactly what to buy or short and when to exit. Trade-Ideas’ “Holly” is like counting cards at a casino and only acting when the odds are in your favor. I know it takes many different skills to build a company like Trade-Ideas.  Tell me about your founding partners. Dan:  David M. Aleriat - Managing Partner has had 20 years of experience trading, consulting, developing software for utilities, capital markets, and consumer products. Trade-Ideas benefits from his ideas in business development, customer acquisition, corporate strategy as well as energy trading and marketing. David holds dual Bachelors of Arts degrees in Economics and French from the University of Texas and a Masters of Business Administration degree from the Cox School of Business at the Southern Methodist University. Philip Smolen - Senior Managing Partner CTO - Phil holds an MS and BS in computer science from the University of Texas at Austin. Phil worked as a senior software architect on trading systems and has worked at Lockheed Martin designing laser guided defense systems. Phil has been the architect of the Trade Ideas data base and real time search technology. Brad Williams - Chief Operations Officer - Brad has over 25 years experience managing financial technology. Brad was the founder of Future Trade Technologies which was sold to Interactive Brokers LLC in 2007.  In 2003 he joined with the other founders to start Trade Ideas LLC. Today we have more than 20 key personnel that make Trade-Ideas, LLC. What milestones have you accomplished and what is your longer term goal? Dan: Currently, we have 20,000 subscribers. We run over 1 million simulated scenarios each evening and broadcast 8 average daily algorithms selected before the open daily. Holly takes all of our developed strategies separates out the top 35 strategies over the past 60 days. She then applies trade filters to decide what should be modified to improve outcomes. After the initial optimization process she teleports to Monte Carlo and redoes everything. Only the strategies with a success rate above 60% and a 2:1 profit factor are visible to our client the following day. We now have 14 years innovating in advanced market analytics. Trade Ideas is the only AI virtual analyst that generates alpha. Professionals around the world are using our technology to rapidly identify opportunities using their own methodology or our generated algorithms. At this point we are unique. Our servers never sleep as they sift through technicals, fundamentals, social media, earnings and more across millions of possible trades every day to find the highest probability risk appropriate opportunities. It is not just about profit, but more importantly it is about risk control that leads to even greater profits. There is a strong Money Ball analogy here as well: “No man is better than a machine and no machine is better than a man with a machine.” Paul Tudor Jones Today, the bulk of assets are passively managed. I envision tremendous growth as investors begin to realize what they are missing, especially using tax deferred funds like IRA’s and charitable trusts.

54," By Michael Amar, Co-organizer of Paris Blockchain Week Summit and Co-founder of Chain Accelerator This year, principal blockchain projects — equipped with heightened mainstream interest — will deploy their infrastructures across the globe and choose a prime location for their European headquarters. But where will they choose: Ireland, Germany, Switzerland? Faced with a continent full of countries that have each embraced blockchain technology, it might seem harder than you think to choose an ideal home for your project. However, amid an increasingly crowded field, one country just got an incredible, €500 million headstart: France. In February, Jean-Michel Mis and Laure de La Raudière, members of the French parliament, released a report recommending investments of upwards of €500 million in blockchain, outlining 20 different proposals that will help pioneer mass adoption of the technology in the country. With this report, the French government has sent an unequivocal message to the world that France is committed to becoming the next leading blockchain nation. And since then, blockchain projects have responded positively by setting up shop in the world’s most premiere tourist destination turned technology epicenter. Below, I’d like to outline a few of the many ways that France is leading the charge for blockchain adoption in Europe, and how its forward-thinking attitude will become a leading example for emerging technologies around the world. Increasing accessibility Blockchain is often compared to the dawn of the internet. In the early 1990s, for example, it would be hard, if not impossible, for even the most ardent supporter of the Macbook to envision what the future of Apple would look like. Whether it’s 1990 or 2090, emerging technologies can be incredibly hard to understand without a foundational background in how they work and why we should use them. It’s a fact that the French government takes very seriously, which is why it has made a concerted effort to educate the general public on decentralized processes. France’s Financia Business School, for instance, recently announced that they will offer post-graduate courses in blockchain and other emerging technologies, serving as a prominent example to other universities about the importance of blockchain education Not only is this significant on its own, but Financia has also decided to allow bitcoin payments for yearly tuition fees. For any technology, mass adoption requires new researchers, developers, institutional consultants, and social enthusiasts — professions that begin at a graduate and postgraduate level. By using higher education to advocate for blockchain technology, France is not only openly advocating for blockchain integration on a mass scale, but it’s also cultivating a pool of top developers to build platforms within the country. Cooperation, not hindrance Blockchain technology rests on 40 years of academic work in mathematics, cryptography, computer science, and telecommunications. However, while its foundation may date back to concepts in the past, its applications are still relatively unknown to government agencies. At least in the near future, it will be increasingly important for government agencies to work with, instead of against, blockchain projects in an effort to remain ahead of an ever changing curve. The fact of the matter is that it will only be a matter of time before blockchain technology permeates every industry and practice area. And the sooner that regulatory bodies realize this, the more prepared they will be to pioneer the digital landscape of the future. Thankfully, equipped with forward-thinking leadership and progressive regulatory policy, France is well on its way to setting the pace for blockchain adoption worldwide. On February 23, French President Emmanuel Macron advocated for the use of blockchain technology to help revitalize supply chain management in the agricultural industry. Macron called upon foreign nations including the United States, China, and Russia to follow France’s lead in introducing new and innovative ways to track produce from farm to table. In a statement, Macron said “Let’s do this in Europe, the avant-garde of agricultural technology, by developing tools that will track every product from raw material production to packaging and processing."" Since taking office, Macron has remained vocal about his commitment to emerging technologies, announcing in 2017 that he wanted to make France a startup nation. By setting the stage for innovation, Macron and other French leaders have set an important example for future growth in the country. In sum The world is changing rapidly, even more than we may realize. The innovations of today vary drastically from the innovations of 5, 10, or even 15 years ago. Who knows what the future may hold for blockchain. One of the great beauties of this emerging technology is that its ability to transform our commercial ecosystem bears near limitless potential. However, one thing is for certain, we won’t get anywhere unless we have the support of government agencies looking to see blockchain adoption develop. With France leading the way, I truly believe we will experience the social momentum necessary to bring blockchain to new heights. So the next time someone asks what the great tech epicenters are, you’d be wise to include France in your answer.",Guest Contributors,"April 12, 2019, 09:51:16 AM EDT",How France is Becoming a Blockchain Epicenter in Europe

56," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While I was excited to hear that the German government is about to invest $1 billion in battery technology… I wasn't surprised. When I was a kid, the hottest cars were mostly all German: Porsche, BMW (OTCMKTS: BMWYY ), Audi (OTCMKTS: AUDVF ), Mercedes. Now they've all been supplanted by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). The Model S is not just an electric car - it's one of the greatest technological achievements of our age, with the ability to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 2.5 seconds. It's one of the fastest production cars ever… and it's practically silent because it runs on batteries. Meanwhile, Germany, like several other European Union (EU) nations, is now flirting with recession . One big factor is that automakers are struggling to maintain factory output while cutting CO 2 emissions by one-third (as mandated by EU regulators in December). Why not kill two birds with one stone? By investing in battery technology, Germany can help its automakers compete with Tesla and ease their regulatory headache. Not to mention, catch up with Asia, which is way out in front of the battery boom. Applications for a piece of this $1 billion pie are due this month. It will be interesting to see what comes of it.  We know that Volkswagen (OTCMKTS: VWAGY ) has applied. And this is a path they've been on for a while. Volkswagen's goal is for 25% of its cars to be fully electric by 2025. And by 2030, the company plans to ""electrify"" all of its 300 cars and SUVs. If met, that would be a game changer. I can tell you it's very ambitious, given where the battery industry is today. And to reach that goal, Volkswagen will need new technology. If batteries aren't something you normally give a lot of thought to - until they die, usually at the most inconvenient time - that's understandable. But it's not just their ""lifespan"" that's an issue: Current battery technology, lithium-ion batteries, relies on materials like cobalt… which is mined from conflict zones (mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo) that are struggling to keep up with demand. And we all remember Samsung's exploding phones. You couldn't get onto a plane for a time without flight attendants warning you about the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. That was all due to a fire risk with its lithium-ion battery. So, you can see why Volkswagen is eager for a new alternative. In fact, it's been working with a Silicon Valley startup to get one. And its new battery technology is a key part of Volkswagen's 2025 goal. The company is already one of the largest car manufacturers in the world, and if it can meet expectations I look for it to become the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in the next decade as well. Continental (OTCMKTS: CTTAY ), a key supplier to these German automakers, also wants in on this very same battery technology. General Motors (NYSE: GM ), Ford (NYSE: F ), Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Honda (NYSE: HMC ), Mitsubishi (OTCMKTS: MMTOF ), Nissan (OTCMKTS: NSANY ), and Hyundai (OTCMKTS: HYMTF ) all want this new battery in their fleets as soon as possible. Audi, Porsche, and Mercedes, too. BMW has already signaled that it will apply for Germany's grant so it can research this new technology. Even if BMW doesn't produce the new battery itself… it can understand how to get the best from its suppliers.  These are major, multinational companies. But as an investor, I'd rather own a pure play on the battery revolution. I often talk about ""picks and shovels"" investing. And that's because, if you look back at the 1849 Gold Rush, it was the folks supplying the picks and shovels who ultimately got rich. Therefore, I'm recommending companies that supply this new battery technology - nicknamed the ""Jesus Battery."" Find out exactly what makes this battery so miraculous here . Any competitors that have it will CRUSH Tesla, by making its $5 billion ""gigafactory"" - with the old lithium-ion batteries - obsolete. If you ever wanted to invest in the coming electric car revolution, but weren't sure how, THIS is your chance. I know I do. So I found a company that holds key patents. Automakers like Toyota are relying on this tiny company for its electric cars. Yet the company is totally off the radar . That makes now the right time to get in before everyone else.

59,"Apparently, people really do judge a book by its cover. Or at   least they do it with music videos, according to new data that   Vevo    exclusively shared with   Variety    this month. The major label-owned music video platform has been   on a quest to optimize the preview thumbnails it is using on   YouTube, and seen double-digit improvements in engagement as a   result. That's especially true for videos released years ago, which   otherwise would have been poised to slowly fade away in YouTube's   ever-expanding catalog. Discovery has been a real problem for   artists and their labels, especially as countless of new clips   are being uploaded to the Google-owned video service every single   day. ""(YouTube) doesn't necessarily prioritize music videos,""   said   Vevo    senior VP JP Evangelista. What's more, music videos historically   haven't done a good job at differentiating themselves from the   crowd. Take ""Ghost,"" from singer / songwriter Halsey, for example.   Back in October 2014, Vevo uploaded an EP cut of the song, dubbed   the Room 93 version, onto YouTube, complete with a relatively   dark thumbnail picture. ""It wasn't standing out, it wasn't   popping,"" said Evangelista.makeArticleAd(); As such, the video performed like many other videos do on the   platform: After an initial spike, activity died down - until   Vevo's team swapped out the thumbnail last September for   something much brighter, with bigger faces of the two   protagonists. The result was a slam dunk: Vevo registered a 4000%   growth in views in the two weeks after the thumbnail change.   After that time, views eventually flattened out again, but still   remained notably above the level they were previous to those   changes. Not every video sees such a dramatic boost from a new   thumbnail, but Vevo has still seen a 12% lift on average for   videos in the first 20 days, and a notable sustained lift after   that when it looked at the effects of changing thumbnails across   close to 4000 catalog videos.  The effect of thumbnail optimization across a sample of     3972 catalog videos.  Adding just a few percent extra viewing, and the advertising   revenue associated with it, can be significant for an artist.   Seeing such a lift across its roster of artists can be massive   for a label. And having thousands, or at some point even tens of   thousands of videos perform incrementally better can be   significant for Vevo as well. The decade-old company is a music   video juggernaut, and continues to be YouTube's single biggest   supplier of videos measured by views. But while Vevo easily maintained double-digit growth in   previous years, it has seen that curve flatten. In 2017, it   clocked 278 billion video views across all of its distribution   channels. In 2018, that number was 286 billion, which equals less   than 3% growth year-over-year. That's why Vevo began its   thumbnail optimization project some 9 months ago to make its vast   catalog of music videos on YouTube more presentable. The idea to optimize cover art for online videos to boost   engagement isn't entirely new: Netflix has turned this type of   image optimization into a science, and   is frequently testing multiple images for the   same show    with its audience to see which one performs best. In fact, the   service   has even begun to show different images to   different segments of its audience    to frame its movies and shows in different ways. That way, some   may see an image highlighting the action of a show, while others   see something that points out the emotional connection between   its protagonists. Vevo can't get as granular, largely because it doesn't control   the platform its videos are playing on. Ever since its founding,   Vevo has been getting most of its video views on YouTube. The   company for some time also operated its own site and apps, and   briefly flirted with the idea of a more independent course off   YouTube. However, those plans were canned when former Vevo CEO   Erik Huggers left the company in late 2018    . Last summer,   Vevo shuttered its own apps and site    to fully focus on its distribution partnerships with YouTube and   a handful of other companies. And with that renewed focus on YouTube, Vevo began to take a   closer look at how it can optimize its videos on the video   service. Thumbnail optimization is just a first step in those   efforts, said Evangelista, adding: ""It's a year-long project for   us."" Vevo may not be able to do true A/B-testing on YouTube the way   Netflix is doing it on its service, but the company has   nonetheless gathered a bunch of data on the types of thumbnails   that work well, and the ways their videos gain steam on Google's   platform. Some of that is fairly obvious: Well-lit images do   better than dark ones, and close-ups on people's faces do better   than shots from further away. Insights into other success factors are less obvious. For   instance, 55% of the traffic for Halsey's ""Ghost (Room 93   version)"" video came from YouTube's browse features, including   the videos YouTube suggests to users on their personalized home   pages. Only 6% came from search. Overall, Vevo now sees 75% of   its traffic coming from algorithmic curation, which includes   personalized home pages, watch next suggestions and   algorithmically curated playlists. This suggests that optimized thumbnails aren't just more   popular with YouTube's users, but also contribute to a virtuous   cycle: Once users click on them more often, YouTube's algorithms   promote them more frequently, leading to further growth. And that   virtuous cycle can also extend beyond a single clip: Vevo has   found that boost an older videos with better thumbnails can also   help to make the release of a new video of the same artist more   popular. So why hasn't Vevo simply swapped out all of the images by   now? Because in the end, such decisions are up to the labels.   ""Everything we do is in partnership with them,"" said Evangelista.   Vevo can suggest images that will likely perform better, but in   some cases, labels or artists may have strong feelings about   using certain imagery. ""It's an art and science conversation,"" he   said.

In fact, the   service   has even begun to show different images to   different segments of its audience    to frame its movies and shows in different ways. That way, some   may see an image highlighting the action of a show, while others   see something that points out the emotional connection between   its protagonists. Vevo can't get as granular, largely because it doesn't control   the platform its videos are playing on. Ever since its founding,   Vevo has been getting most of its video views on YouTube. The   company for some time also operated its own site and apps, and   briefly flirted with the idea of a more independent course off   YouTube. However, those plans were canned when former Vevo CEO   Erik Huggers left the company in late 2018    . Last summer,   Vevo shuttered its own apps and site    to fully focus on its distribution partnerships with YouTube and   a handful of other companies. And with that renewed focus on YouTube, Vevo began to take a   closer look at how it can optimize its videos on the video   service. Thumbnail optimization is just a first step in those   efforts, said Evangelista, adding: ""It's a year-long project for   us."" Vevo may not be able to do true A/B-testing on YouTube the way   Netflix is doing it on its service, but the company has   nonetheless gathered a bunch of data on the types of thumbnails   that work well, and the ways their videos gain steam on Google's   platform. Some of that is fairly obvious: Well-lit images do   better than dark ones, and close-ups on people's faces do better   than shots from further away. Insights into other success factors are less obvious. For   instance, 55% of the traffic for Halsey's ""Ghost (Room 93   version)"" video came from YouTube's browse features, including   the videos YouTube suggests to users on their personalized home   pages. Only 6% came from search. Overall, Vevo now sees 75% of   its traffic coming from algorithmic curation, which includes   personalized home pages, watch next suggestions and   algorithmically curated playlists. This suggests that optimized thumbnails aren't just more   popular with YouTube's users, but also contribute to a virtuous   cycle: Once users click on them more often, YouTube's algorithms   promote them more frequently, leading to further growth. And that   virtuous cycle can also extend beyond a single clip: Vevo has   found that boost an older videos with better thumbnails can also   help to make the release of a new video of the same artist more   popular. So why hasn't Vevo simply swapped out all of the images by   now? Because in the end, such decisions are up to the labels.   ""Everything we do is in partnership with them,"" said Evangelista.   Vevo can suggest images that will likely perform better, but in   some cases, labels or artists may have strong feelings about   using certain imagery. ""It's an art and science conversation,"" he   said.

63,"Shutterstock photo It’s been a banner year so far for tech investors – at least if you’re putting your money on the giant FAANG stocks. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google, of course) are all up in the last three months and show serious potential for further gains. Their performance has powered the Nasdaq index to its 19% year-to-date gain, and three of them have significantly exceeded the overall index. Let’s dive into the TipRanks analyst database, and see why Wall Street’s top market watchers are so bullish on the best-performing FAANGs. TipRanks assembles all of the top analysts’ reviews in one place, putting Wall Street’s best data and analysis at your fingertips. Apple, Inc. (AAPL – Research Report) If there’s one thing a tech investor should know, it’s to never count Apple out. This company has been on the ropes before and has always bounced back – from its low PC market share in the 1980s to the minor panic that followed Steve Jobs’ death in 2011, Apple has always found a path back to the top. That path usually involves both niche appeal and product innovation, and the present is no exception. Apple’s slip at the end of last year – when it lost 38% in three months – is well documented but appears to have reflected investors’ worries over temporary factors. Recent changes – including political success on the China trade issues, steady iPhone market share despite generally slowing sales, CEO Tim Cook’s announcement of upcoming new products and services, and a belated recognition of the nearly billion-strong global user base to support those initiatives – have all boosted the stock. AAPL has gained 27% since January 2. Wall Street’s analysts are focusing on Apple’s appeal, and its ability to capitalize on its customer base. Writing from Merrill Lynch, Wamsi Mohan (Track Record & Ratings) points out that the company has a clear path to boosting sales of new-model iPhones in its upgrade trade-in program. The program lowers the cost of buying a new iPhone, and Mohan points out that it, “targets the most commonly owned iPhones, meaning the program could lead to a large number of upgrades.” He also points out Apple’s history of turning adversity into success: “Apple’s stock remains inexpensive, and the company has shown it can grow revenue consistently.” In line with his optimistic stance on Apple, Mohan gives the stock a $220 price target, suggesting an upside potential of 9%. Also taking a bullish view on Apple is five-star analyst Michael Olson (Track Record & Ratings) of Piper Jaffray. He bases his conclusions on an interesting survey done of 8,000 teenaged smartphone users, which showed that 83% have an iPhone, and that 86% want their next smartphone device to be an iPhone. Additionally, the Apple Watch was the top wearable device, with a 20% share among teens. Numbers like these bode well Apple in the long run, positioning the company to keep a loyal user base for a long time. According to Olson, it is a sign “that Apple's place as the dominant device brand among teens remains well intact.” He gives Apple shares a $201 price target, indicating that he believes Apple’s current share price, $200, is about right. The analyst consensus on Apple remains a ‘Moderate Buy’ for now, with 15 buy ratings and 12 holds assigned by the market’s best analysts over the past three months. The average price target is $195, some 2.5% lower than the current share price of $200 – but Apple shares have been rising so quickly this month that the analysts’ price targets have not yet caught up with the stock’s current positioning.  Facebook, Inc. (FB – Research Report) The social media giant is working to put its bad press in the past, but more importantly, the investing public has grown more comfortable with the idea that data and privacy issues are more and more falling under the rubric of private companies. For the better part of two decades now, we’ve all known that our online data can be sold to advertisers; it would seem that we’re finally getting used to that fact. What’s better for Facebook is actually the same underlying factor that supports Apple: a massive user base. Facebook has over 2.5 billion users among its various apps. Remembering that there is significant overlap (How many of these apps are on your phone?), the breakdown is: 2.3 billion Facebook users, 1 billion Instagram users, 1.5 billion on WhatsApp, and 1.3 billion on Messenger. All of this has pushed Facebook shares to a 31% gain so far this year. The analysts agree that Facebook’s future is bright. Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak (Track Record & Ratings) bases his ‘Buy’ rating on the company’s income potential, saying, “Instagram's commerce opportunity could add $4B or more to North America ad revenue by 2021.” He gives FB a $195 price target, indicating he sees a 9% upside to the stock. Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris (Track Record & Ratings) agrees with Nowak, describing Facebook’s platform growth as “solid,” and adding that there is “potential for commerce and messaging monetization opportunities attractively priced within shares.” Morris does not ignore the privacy issues that have dogged social media over the years, either. He points out, “Investors will continue to gain comfort with the incremental financial risk created by content and privacy concerns.” With the prime risk factor growing more acceptable, and potential for income rising, it only makes sense that Facebook should get a strong upside. Morris sets a price target of $200, suggesting a potential upside of 12%. Facebook’s analyst consensus, based on ratings by the bets performing analysts over the past three months, is a ‘Strong Buy.’ 31 reviewers gave buy ratings to the stock, compared to only 6 holds. The average price target of $196, compared to the share price of $177, gives the stock a 10% upside.  Netflix, Inc. (NFLX – Research Report) Online marketers can tell you, “Content is King.” Apple believes this, and is linking its future to the new streaming service to unveiled this year. Disney (DIS) is also setting up a content streaming service, and even old names in telecom are getting into the content field – AT&T (T) bought TimeWarner mainly to gain control of a creative base for a content service to mate with its wireless internet. Netflix, however, was first. Originally an online ordering service for DVDs, the company successfully adapted to changing technology and converted itself into the prime source for original – and more importantly, high quality – movies streamed online. Netflix has been wildly successful in the streaming arena, and its stock is up 36% so far this year. That’s not to say that the road is easy. Netflix’ Achilles Heel is an ongoing cash hemorrhage. The company spent $13 billion on programming last year and is expected to hit $15 billion this year. Quality movies don’t come cheap; one current offering, The Highwaymen, stars A-listers Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson. The flipside, of course, is that good programming will draw in and hold subscribers. Holding subscribers may be key. Michael Olson, quoted above on Apple, looks at data in the same Piper Jaffray teen survey in setting his bullish stand on Netflix. Noting that Netflix holds 37% market share among teens, he says, “Netflix is the leader in a category that contains massive multi-year growth potential as more content viewing shifts online.” His price target for the stock, $440, suggests an upside of 21%. Also upbeat on Netflix is Stifel’s Scott Devitt (Track Record & Ratings), who sees the prospect of increased competition as a potential boon for the company, offering the possibility of stable niches: “The Disney+ service will be targeted to the family-friendly programming tier, whereas many of Netflix’s biggest original hits and original content spending have concentrated on the adult audience.” Devitt set a $400 price target for NFLX shares, suggesting a 9% upside to the stock. Overall, Netflix has ‘Strong Buy’ consensus, again based on the past three months’ reviews by the best performing analysts. The breakdown is 21 buys and 6 holds. The stock is currently selling for $363, so the average price target of $421 indicates an upside potential of 15%.

66,"By Landon Manning Despite a slump in crypto asset prices during the so-called “crypto winter,” venture capitalists are continuing to pour massive amounts of funding into a variety of blockchain projects. BeInCrypto reported its recent findings on blockchain investment, claiming that venture capitalists have exceeded expectations of investment into distributed ledger technology. Indeed, the site claimed that the first quarter of 2019 has already seen $335 million pouring into various blockchain startups from venture capitalist firms alone. However, the data from 2019 so far has shown that it is unlikely to match 2018 in the total amount of funds raised for blockchain-based enterprises. Last year was a booming one for investment into the blockchain industry, with more than $3 billion raised from venture capital firms. Many of the largest investments went to crypto mining equipment, with Bitmain gathering over $1 billion itself, and smaller players, like Bitfury, still raking in over $80 million. Still, at this rate, 2019 seems well on track to blow 2017 out of the water, showing that the dip in interest caused by the long-term bear market did not eliminate wider interest in the various applications of distributed ledger technology. As BeInCrypto reported, interest in speculation on crypto asset prices has dwindled, and investors now seem more interested in more diverse and longer-term investments. MIT Technology Review also conducted research into this phenomenon, finding that one company has already secured more than $60 million in 2019 venture capital investments. Niraj Pant, a partner at the venture capital firm Polychain Capital, described some of the differences between this slump and previous ones in the greater fintech industry. Pant claimed that in 2015, it “felt like everything was really dead, and we weren’t sure if the market would pick back up. Now it still feels like there’s still a lot of stuff going on.” Institutional investors, such as hedge funds, are showing increased interest in blockchain startups, which signals a growth in trustworthiness and a sense of broader adoption trends. In addition to supporting a variety of new projects intended to capitalize on the same principles of distributed ledger technology, venture capitalists are also looking toward the possibilities of decentralized finance in the future. “I think we will see blockchains scale in the next few years to allow mainstream consumer applcations [sic] to be built,” Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures wrote on his blog. “But until then, DeFi [decentralized finance] is a good place to hang out.”",Bitcoin Magazine,"April 10, 2019, 02:59:25 PM EDT",Venture Capitalists Continue Substantial Blockchain Investments

72,"A week or so after the Lyft (LYFT) IPO, the popular narrative seems to be that trading has been a bit of a flop, and this has negative implications for other so-called “unicorns” that are scheduled to go public later this year. The problem with that analysis is that it doesn't quite mesh with reality, and the implications for upcoming IPOs may be different from conventional wisdom. When a company offers shares to the public, the success of the offering to them is not really tied to what happens to the stock in the weeks that follow. The short-term success is measured by the level of pre-IPO demand for shares at the offering price, while the long-term success is only measurable after a year or two as a public company, or at the very least once a couple of earnings reports have been released. What happens in between may not suit some over-enthusiastic traders, but it doesn’t reflect on the company, nor the investment bankers who advised them in the run-up to the offering. The job of those bankers is to maximize the returns to the company from the IPO. That is done by drumming up demand, then pricing the shares at the highest possible point while reflecting that demand. From that perspective, Lyft’s launch was a huge success. They priced the shares just above the top end of earlier estimates, resulting in a valuation of $21 billion, yet the initial offering was still over-subscribed. There was even enough residual demand to ensure that the shares initially traded higher, enabling those looking for a quick profit to take one if they chose. As those same investment bankers start to consider pricing for Uber, Pinterest, and other tech unicorns yet to debut, the lesson from all of that is likely to be that growth is still valued. One could argue that because LYFT is now below that $72 mark, it will temper enthusiasm for those future offerings, but history would argue against you. That pattern is not unusual in high-profile IPOs and has little or no bearing on either the long-term future of that stock, nor enthusiasm for upcoming listings. So, if the focus is on growth, what does that mean for the two big unicorns that look to be next in line, Uber and Pinterest? There are questions about the growth of both, but in both cases, there are also answers to those questions. Pinterest saw user growth slow as other social media platforms attacked its format head on, but having survived that, is expected to return to decent user growth soon. There is also lots of room for improvement in the revenue-per-user metrics. Pinterest is currently behind Twitter (TWTR) on that basis, but with them and Facebook (FB) having shown the way to improve monetization, Pinterest has the benefit of a clear road-map. That is why the first pre-IPO analyst's call is bullish. Uber is still growing quickly, but the knock on them is that the rate of growth has apparently slowed a bit recently. That is likely down to two things. First, there is increased competition in the space, not just from Lyft, but also from a whole host of smaller, regional companies around the world. That will inevitably slow growth, but the fact that they are still growing shows the benefit of being the first and best-known in a market. Second, the law of large numbers (in a stock analysis sense) comes into play. Simple logic dictates that it is far easier to achieve, say, forty percent growth on a small number than on a large one. The flip side of that though is that smaller percentage increases in large user numbers result in big increases in overall revenue. There are essentially two types of investor in an IPO, those looking to make a quick buck and those that see long-term potential in the stock. The Lyft offering allowed for the first, and the jury is still out on the second, so those saying that the current price of the stock will have a negative impact on what is to come for Lyft and other unicorn IPOs are mistaken.",Martin Tillier,"April 10, 2019, 10:47:30 AM EDT","LYFT's IPO Has Implications For Other Unicorns, But Not What You Might Think"
73," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) stock has been on a smartphone roller coaster, and that ride has been bumpy lately, with smartphone sales declining while a legal battle with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rages on. Diversification into laptop and smartwatch processors has yet to pay off in a meaningful way, but now the company has another play: data centers. Yesterday, QCOM took the wraps off Qualcomm Cloud AI 100, a new processor aimed at data centers where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly important.  At an event on April 9, Qualcomm announced a new processor , targeting a new market for the company. The new Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 is aimed at data centers where AI is critical. The process known as ""AI inferencing"" is where already trained AI puts what it has learned to practical use. For example, AI inference is used to recognize images, to make recommendations to online shoppers or to translate speech into text. Qualcomm's approach is to use its expertise in designing the mobile processors used in smartphones, and apply this approach to AI. Smartphones require significant processing power in a very compact package, and it must be an extremely energy efficient design. The Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 isn't as powerful as the competition's AI inference chips, but it has two key advantages carried over from that smartphone expertise: less heat generated, and much lower power consumption. One of the biggest operational expenses of a datacenter is powering and cooling all the processors inside. That operation is so energy intensive that data centers are predicted to consume 20% of global electricity production by 2025 . QCOM says its Cloud AI 100's low energy requirements offers 10 times the power performance of competing chips. Expected to begin testing later this year with partners including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), they are scheduled to go into production in 2020. Qualcomm says that with its manufacturing capability, it will be able to ramp up output to meet demand very quickly. The datacenter market is a big one, and within that broad category, the datacenter accelerator market - AI inference - was worth an estimated $2.84 billion in 2018. But it's forecast to grow at a CAGR of 49.47% to hit $21.19 billion by 2023 . That's just short of Qualcomm's $22.73 billion in total annual revenue for 2018. The potential payoff for QCOM is big, but so is the competition. The Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 will be going up against established datacenter powerhouses Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). In addition, Reuters points out that tech giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google are making their own AI inference chips . QCOM says it is focusing on the smaller data centers that are proliferating globally as mobile apps and other connected services push for faster response times. These smaller ""edge"" data centers lack the cooling infrastructure needed to power endless racks of Nvidia or Intel chips, they tend to be more cost sensitive and most don't need the same raw computational power a company like Google expects. The Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 with its high performance-per-watt is ideal for these edge data centers. QCOM's focus on the smartphone market took Qualcomm stock to near record heights in 2014, but since then it has been up and down. Currently, QCOM is off those 2014 levels by about 30%, but it has been trending up and InvestorPlace's Chris Tyler wrote it was a buy . That was a day before the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 announcement. Add the company's new push into the lucrative data center market, and QCOM's future is definitely looking rosier. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s. The post How Serious Is Qualcomm's Data Center Play? appeared first on InvestorPlace .

75,"Is it possible that the smartphones that have come to consume our lives are already knocking at the door of oblivion? The CEO of one of the world’s largest telecoms companies thinks so … Back in the 1970s, when the very first mobile phone was released, it weighed more than two pounds, was priced at almost $4,000 and took 10 hours to charge, after which one could hold a half-hour conversation before the battery died. Four decades later, and we have the smartphone, and no one can imagine life without them—or without all the bells and whistles, including everything from 3D facial recognition to state-of-the-art cameras. It’s gone far beyond making phone calls, an act that is going the way of the paper and pen itself. Which brings us to the latest prophetic statement from AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, who opined earlier this month that the smartphone is a “crutch” that is doomed. Stephenson’s view is that we’re having another 1970s moment…when we realize that what we’ve developed is cool, but primitive and just the beginning of something much more sophisticated. And the sophistication comes in the form of … nothing tangible. ""We carry around these devices and they're bigger than they should be... I say they go away…It is conceivable that we're going to be moving into a world without screens, a world where glasses are your screen,” Stephenson said. According to the AT&T CEO, the advent of 5G--whose development is so significant that it’s become the stuff of political campaigning--will move all the storage and computing power of mobile phones from the device to the network, rendering the physical phone itself irrelevant. According to a recent Ericsson survey, 92 percent of executives from 100 major global telecom operators believe that 5G is the foundation for emerging new technologies not only for smartphones but also for self-driving cars, smart cities … the digital world that is clawing its way to the surface of our reality. What does it mean for phones, exactly? Well, not much in the next few years, at all, as the main carriers in the U.S. are just now in the process of preparing to launch 5G networks. In much of the world, 5G will be released later this year, with a number of phones unveiled to support the network, including the Huawei Mate X, LG V50 ThinQ, Samsung Galaxy S10 and a handful of others. Apple was reported to be sitting out the technology until at least 2020. Coverage will also be limited, and nationwide 5G coverage will take some time with some areas to be included closer to 2024. But as far ahead into the future as we can reasonably see, the sentiment is that smartphones will eventually be replaced by augmented reality glasses—the apparent elixir to our obsessive phone use (or will it just replace one obsession with another?) A number of big companies and emerging start-ups are already working in the field of smart and connected glasses, and quite of few are already on the market. They haven’t, though, attracted much of a customer base just yet. Take  Google Glass, for instance, or Microsoft’s HoloLens mixed reality headsets, which put you in touch with your favorite holograms but aren’t intended for walking around with; rather, they are for professionals taking medical and engineering technology to great new heights.  Google Glass  Microsoft HoloLens 2 The problem is that they’re not exactly attractive, and vanity still rules the day. Few want to be the lone wearer of large glasses on the street. Until it’s been deemed a fashion fad by a trendy designer, it's probably not going to gain much momentum. But the brains behind the AR glasses know this, and recently they’ve been making moves to team up with fashion companies to come out with something considered actually “wearable”. In collaboration with one Korean eyewear designer, Huawei announced it is entering the smart glasses market by July this year. An Amazon-backed company called North is working on a similar idea with glasses called Focals, which are expected to go on sale by the end of this year. North’s “Focals”  Source: CNBC Some media speculate that even Apple is preparing to release its augmented reality glasses next year. So, by next year we could already start seeing fewer phones and more “glasses” on the streets, and from that point, in the whirlwind of technology adoption, it’s probably not far-fetched to say we aren’t too many years away from the end of the smartphone.

79," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) revenue is currently dominated by iPhone sales. However, after a decade of massive growth that saw Apple stock hit record highs, that revenue stream is threatened by a softening smartphone market. AAPL has placed an emphasis on services and hardware like wearables to help replace that declining iPhone revenue. A report from analysts at Morgan Stanley suggests a shift to healthcare could actually be the big win for Apple, with the company positioned to disrupt that industry much the way it did with the music and mobile phone markets.  The kicker? Healthcare is a massive industry, worth $3.5 trillion in the U.S. alone. In less than a decade, AAPL could potentially end up with a revenue stream even larger than the iPhone. Imagine what that would do for Apple stock. Morgan Stanley analysts released a report yesterday (via Fortune ) and it's a bombshell for AAPL investors. Worries about declining iPhone revenue have hurt Apple stock and the push to make up for that with services hasn't been entirely smooth sailing, with new initiatives like Apple TV+ video streaming getting a tepid response . Morgan Stanley thinks healthcare could be the true successor to the iPhone. AAPL could leverage its extremely popular wearables - the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless earbuds - by adding more medical-grade technology. For example, adapting the AirPods to be hearing aides, or adding blood pressure monitoring capability to the Apple Watch. The hardware is just part of a growing health ecosystem Apple has developed, including the iOS Health App, and ReasearchKit, which was used by a recent Stanford study that tracked heart data for over 400,000 Apple Watch users . The company also has a $245 billion in cash on hand, which could be used to purchase a healthcare company or technology. The final piece of the puzzle is Apple's reputation for privacy protection, something other tech companies eyeing the healthcare market like Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) currently lack. According to the Morgan Stanley team, a successful Apple disruption of the healthcare market could pay off with anywhere from $15 billion to as much as $313 billion in new revenue by 2027. At the upper end that would not only dwarf the money AAPL makes from iPhone sales, healthcare revenue alone would eclipse the company's $265.5 billion total annual revenue for 2018. That is some serious upside for Apple stock. The idea that AAPL could monetize its growing forays into healthcare isn't new. The catalyst has been the Apple Watch. Since its introduction in 2015, AAPL has shifted the focus of the Apple Watch from being a ""computer on your wrist"" smartwatch to being a health and fitness wearable.  The latest version of the device includes integrated ECG test capability  and fall detection. Apple has been talking to Medicare providers about subsidizing the Apple Watch for seniors . In 2017, Apple acquired sleep tracking company Beddit , although it has yet to integrate that technology into the Apple Watch. The company has also hired teams of healthcare professionals as it seeks ways to boost Apple Watch adoption through features like an integrated blood glucose sensor for diabetics . The Apple Watch has become a key part of the company's push into healthcare. Morgan Stanley is suggesting the company has the pieces in place to leverage not just the Apple Watch, but also its relationship with medical researchers, its reputation for privacy protection - and its deep pockets - to make a move that could disrupt healthcare. The idea of AAPL pivoting to become a company where healthcare is a big source of revenue - if not its primary source of revenue - may seem farfetched. But the company has reinvented itself multiple times already. In the 1990s when it was a struggling computer company, few foresaw a time when Apple would disrupt the global music industry and transform into an electronics company with iTunes and the iPod. And even at the iPod's pinnacle, not many people would have pictured a company where smartphones accounted for over 60% of the company's revenue, driving Apple stock to the point of a trillion dollar market cap. Services are a big part of AAPL's future, but if the cards fall into place, healthcare could be the next big driver of Apple revenue - and it could make the iPhone era look like small potatoes in comparison. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s. The post Why Healthcare Could Be the Next Big Thing for Apple Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .

These robots are already at work in 360 WMT locations. The Walmart robot janitor is the ""Auto-C"". This robot is capable of cleaning floors on its own. The company notes that an associate must prep the area first, though. However, once prepped, the bot can clean up instead of the associate. According to the company, the advantage of the Walmart robot janitor is that it will free up more time for its associates. This will allow them to be more productive and not have to focus as much on mundane tasks.

84,"Shutterstock photo By Lars Seier Christensen, Chairman, Concordium There is no doubt about the enormous potential of blockchain technology. Since its inception, developers have explored numerous exciting albeit generally immature applications to harness its benefits. Thanks to the excitement surrounding the space, most people have at least heard of blockchain or bitcoin. However, existing blockchains have a number of inherent flaws in their fundamental structure and underlying principles that perhaps explain why there has not been real mainstream adoption — despite the potential for truly impactful real-world use cases. Let’s consider some of the barriers: Privacy as opposed to anonymity The promise of anonymity on the blockchain was an ideological choice for early generations but incompatible with the requirements of modern society. No serious business will even consider building a mission-critical application on top of a blockchain where they cannot know with certainty that they are dealing with identifiable counterparts. But where privacy — not anonymity — is in fact appropriate, the same early generations create a false impression of privacy since transaction details are recorded on a public ledger and linked to a unique public address. In the digital age, connecting the dots to identify the person behind an account is far from impossible. So perfect privacy for legitimate uses does not exist today, and this is a major area of development. Modern cryptographic advances promise solutions, e.g., zero-knowledge proofs. The current generations, unfortunately, have also become a hotbed for criminal activity because users do not need to verify their identities to transact. In order for there to be more trust in blockchain, users need to know their information is truly secure and their counterparts are legitimate actors. Stigma and lack of knowledge As blockchain is the underlying technology behind digital currencies such as bitcoin, many people associate it with market volatility. 2018 was a particularly turbulent year for digital currencies, with the cryptocurrency market hitting an all-time low. However, many people don’t understand that cryptocurrency is only one of the numerous applications of blockchain. In order for blockchain to see mainstream adoption, public awareness of its immense potential will need to be heightened. Unknown regulatory environment One of the biggest barriers to the mainstream adoption of blockchain remains the uncertain regulatory environment. Unsurprisingly, given the rapid speed of development, regulations in most jurisdictions has not kept up with the pace of developments in the blockchain space. Many people fear if there is no regulation in place, they may fall victim to scams. On an enterprise level, businesses are reluctant to implement blockchain without known regulations, because if and when regulations are implemented, they may have to make costly fixes or scrap their blockchains altogether. Ultimately, regulation is a key missing component of the blockchain puzzle. As the regulatory environment becomes more stable, more mainstream adoption will undoubtedly follow suit. Smart contract verification features Smart contracts were a paradigm shift for blockchains in regards to business applications. However, one shortcoming is that most existing networks lack the capacity to formally verify these contracts operate according to requirements. Given that smart contracts are also immutable on most networks, they cannot be modified after execution. As a result, there have been reports of bugs that leave room for hackers to exploit, much to the chagrin of users. Once these features are ironed out through testing, individuals or businesses are likely to begin to adopt smart contracts into their everyday business practices. Although blockchain technology has made significant progress over the past few years, it is still a nascent technology. As we begin to build a more secure, stable space for potential users and investors alike, people will begin to appreciate the hugely beneficial real-world applications of blockchain. In due time, as many people have purported for years, blockchain will have the potential to transform business as we know it. The lack of trust in areas where trust does not exist today and is either too expensive or complicated to establish is a major obstacle in many business operations, and blockchain has the potential to solve this critical issue. This is a bigger game changer than most business people appreciate and could revolutionize the way we interact and do business today with immense economic growth and investment opportunities arising — in a similar fashion to how the internet opened up entirely new avenues for hitherto unknown business models. This is the real promise of the blockchain, and it is a big deal.

85,"When news about   Brightcove acquiring its long-time competitor   Ooyala's online video platform business for $15 million    broke in February, many assumed that this would be the end of it   for   Ooyala    . Turns out that was wrong: The acquisition officially closed   last week,   Ooyala    is still and independent company, and its CEO Jonathan Huberman   recently caught up with   Variety    talk about his company's new focus, and the changing online video   business. First, a bit of a refresher: Ooyala had been one of the   companies providing the plumbing for the nascent online video   business ever since its founding in 2007. Initially, it focused   on providing video hosting for other companies, with a particular   focus on the media business. Later, complemented this with   ad-tech and video management tools. The entry into the ad-tech market in 2014 coincided with   Ooyala getting acquired by Australian telco giant Telstra, which   at the time hoped to become a major technology player, with a   significant digital advertising business to boot. Ooyala's second   major focus at the time was the video platform business, as   hosting and related infrastructure services are called in the   industry, with video management tools ranking last on the list of   the company's internal priorities.makeArticleAd(); However, Telstra made a course correction last year, writing   down much of its investment in Ooyala, and subsequently selling   the company to Ooyala's management for an undisclosed amount. That newfound independence forced Ooyala to take a hard look   at its existing lines of business - and realize that its   priorities didn't make a lot of sense, argued Huberman. ""We had   that pyramid inverted,"" he told   Variety    in an exclusive interview last week. The ad-tech business in   particular was a lot more challenging than Ooyala had   anticipated. ""We were competing with this little company called   Google,"" joked Huberman. Ooyala ended up selling its ad-tech   business in December. What's more, the traditional platform business wasn't seeing   nearly as much growth as Ooyala's video management tools. ""The   media and entertainment space has become saturated,"" said   Huberman. There wasn't much room to grow with video hosting for   media organizations anymore, and competitor      Brightcove    was much better positioned in the enterprise video market - which   is why the company decided to sell its platform business to its   longtime competitor earlier this year. The new Ooyala is entirely focused on what it calls its Flex   Media Platform - a set of video management tools that help   publishers with their entire supply chain, from production to   publishing and analytics. It's an underserved niche, argued   Huberman, with many media companies not having anything similar   in place. ""We are replacing spreadsheets and Google Docs,"" he   quipped. Much of Ooyala's work these days has been about helping   companies integrate various bits and pieces from a variety of   vendors into a unified workflow. Just this week, the company   announced an integration with Google Cloud Video Intelligence and   Avid's Media Composer tools at NAB in Las Vegas. It's nuts and bolts kind of stuff, but it's been paying off   for Ooyala, with Huberman saying that the company's Flex business   has been doubling in size year-over-year, compared to the   single-digit growth it had seen in the video platform business.   Some of Ooyala's Flex customers include HBO, Turner and Arsenal   FC, with the company set to announce a new deal with U.K.   post-production house The Picture Production Company this   week. But while much of what Ooyala is doing is about the plumbing   that's powering online video behind the scenes, there is also a   bigger industry story behind the company's shift of focus.   Traditional media companies are increasingly being challenged by   tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Google and Netflix. The tech giants aren't just spending billions of dollars on   content, but also have huge teams to develop sophisticated   technology for their video businesses in-house. And in may cases,   these companies can subsidize their massive tech investments with   money from other lines of business - be it ad sales for Google or   iPhones for Apple. ""Profits have a different meaning"" to these   companies, said Huberman. To compete with these deep pockets, media companies not only   have to step up their game and bet big on online content, but   also increase their efficiency to make sure they squeeze out   every penny out of the videos they have - something that's not   that easy if you rely on spreadsheets and Google Docs. That drive   to efficiency will further help Ooyala grow its suite of video   management tools. ""It is a green-field opportunity,"" said   Huberman.

""We were competing with this little company called   Google,"" joked Huberman. Ooyala ended up selling its ad-tech   business in December. What's more, the traditional platform business wasn't seeing   nearly as much growth as Ooyala's video management tools. ""The   media and entertainment space has become saturated,"" said   Huberman. There wasn't much room to grow with video hosting for   media organizations anymore, and competitor      Brightcove    was much better positioned in the enterprise video market - which   is why the company decided to sell its platform business to its   longtime competitor earlier this year. The new Ooyala is entirely focused on what it calls its Flex   Media Platform - a set of video management tools that help   publishers with their entire supply chain, from production to   publishing and analytics. It's an underserved niche, argued   Huberman, with many media companies not having anything similar   in place. ""We are replacing spreadsheets and Google Docs,"" he   quipped. Much of Ooyala's work these days has been about helping   companies integrate various bits and pieces from a variety of   vendors into a unified workflow. Just this week, the company   announced an integration with Google Cloud Video Intelligence and   Avid's Media Composer tools at NAB in Las Vegas. It's nuts and bolts kind of stuff, but it's been paying off   for Ooyala, with Huberman saying that the company's Flex business   has been doubling in size year-over-year, compared to the   single-digit growth it had seen in the video platform business.   Some of Ooyala's Flex customers include HBO, Turner and Arsenal   FC, with the company set to announce a new deal with U.K.   post-production house The Picture Production Company this   week. But while much of what Ooyala is doing is about the plumbing   that's powering online video behind the scenes, there is also a   bigger industry story behind the company's shift of focus.   Traditional media companies are increasingly being challenged by   tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Google and Netflix. The tech giants aren't just spending billions of dollars on   content, but also have huge teams to develop sophisticated   technology for their video businesses in-house. And in may cases,   these companies can subsidize their massive tech investments with   money from other lines of business - be it ad sales for Google or   iPhones for Apple. ""Profits have a different meaning"" to these   companies, said Huberman. To compete with these deep pockets, media companies not only   have to step up their game and bet big on online content, but   also increase their efficiency to make sure they squeeze out   every penny out of the videos they have - something that's not   that easy if you rely on spreadsheets and Google Docs. That drive   to efficiency will further help Ooyala grow its suite of video   management tools. ""It is a green-field opportunity,"" said   Huberman.

92,"Swedish furniture retailer   Ikea    and smart speaker maker   Sonos    announced their first two joint products Monday: The furniture   giant will begin selling a $99 internet-connected bookshelf   speaker and a $179 table lamp that doubles as a smart speaker   this August. The two devices will be marketed under the Symfonisk branding,   and both will be controllable through the   Sonos    app.  Ikea    's $99 Symfonisk model can be used as a traditional bookshelf   speaker, with an option to place it vertically or horizontally.   In addition, it also comes with an integrated bracket for wall   mounting, which means that it can be used as a shelf of its own,   or be used in lieu of a traditional bedside table, capable of   supporting up to 3 kg (about 6.6 lbs) of weight.makeArticleAd(); ""It's a really versatile product,"" said Ikea's smart home   global business leader Björn Block in an interview with   Variety    , calling it ""something that can be in every room."" The $179 Symfonisk table lamp promises to combine light and   sound in one single device. Block said that the integration was   informed by Ikea's previous integrations of wireless charging   into bedside tables and other furniture. However, he also seemed   aware that the unusual combination may not appeal to everyone.   ""It is more of a signature product,"" Block said. Block explained that Ikea had decades of experience with   lights, which have helped the company as it launched its first   internet-connected light bulbs in 2017. The company early on   decided that it wanted to complement smart lights with smart   sound. ""We were wise enough to realize that this is not something   we can do ourselves,"" he said. The collaboration between Ikea and Sonos started in March of   2016, and was also a major departure for the speaker maker. ""We   have never done anything like this before,"" said Sonos CEO   Patrick Spence. ""This has been a huge cultural shift for   Sonos."" A shift that could potentially have a major upside for the   speaker maker: Not only is Sonos financially benefiting from   every Symfonisk speaker Ikea is selling, the new devices also   have the potential to introduce many new consumers to   Sonos-powered products. That's especially true for consumers who couldn't afford Sonos   speakers with their $200 to $800 price tags before, with Spence   specifically citing the college market as a new opportunity. And   since Ikea's speakers interoperate with other Sonos products,   Symfonisk buyers may be more inclined to buy a Sonos soundbar or   another speaker made by the company down the line. Another bonus is Ikea's huge international footprint. The   furniture giant and its franchise partners operate stores in 36   countries. Sonos on the other hand has been generating 85% of its   revenue in just 5 countries. And even in those countries,   consumers don't always get to listen to try a speaker in stores,   where the products sometimes simply sit next to other boxes on   shelves. Ikea will roll out a new in-store experience in August to   showcase the new speakers, said Block. ""This is super exciting   for us,"" added Spence. ""It creates a new way of experiencing   Sonos."" One feature the two devices will be lacking is far-field voice   control. Neither speaker will have microphones built-in, which   could turn off some consumers as they compare them to competing   products from Amazon and Google. Then again, plenty of consumers   already do have some voice control in their home, be it through   smart displays or small speakers like the Amazon Dot that don't   quite cut it for daily music listening. Symfonisk speakers can be   controlled via Alexa from such devices,   with a Google Assistant integration being   imminent.  The two executives also suggested that Symfonisk speakers with   integrated microphones may be not far behind. ""We are absolutely   looking at this for the future,"" Spence said.

93," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The relationship between Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has deteriorated in recent months. In the latest example of the growing animosity between the two, with no warning, Netflix AirPlay support has abruptly ended. Apple recently inked high profile deals with number of TV manufacturers to include AirPlay 2 support - a big deal, given the feature has previously required an Apple TV streamer to work - but with the Netflix move, Apple device users can no longer stream Netflix to those TVs. In fact, they can no longer stream Netflix content to an Apple TV either…  The move is more of a nuisance than anything for most users, but it serves notice that AAPL is facing a battle as it pivots to services in an attempt to wean revenue reliance and Apple stock value off iPhone sales. On Friday, owners of Apple devices noticed that when they tried to cast Netflix content from their iPhone or iPad, it failed . Netflix AirPlay support has been available on these devices since 2013, so that was definitely odd. Netflix quietly added a note to its mobile devices support page , stating, ""Airplay is no longer supported for use with Netflix due to technical limitations."" Further investigation showed that not only had Netflix AirPlay support stopped working with TVs that support AirPlay, but it had also been shut down with the Apple TV set-top streamer. As new of the Netflix move began to make headlines, the company issued a statement explaining its actions (via MacRumors ): ""We want to make sure our members have a great Netflix experience on any device they use. With AirPlay support rolling out to third-party devices, there isn't a way for us to distinguish between devices (what is an Apple TV vs. what isn't) or certify these experiences. Therefore, we have decided to discontinue Netflix AirPlay support to ensure our standard of quality for viewing is being met. Members can continue to access Netflix on the built-in app across Apple TV and other devices."" It's not clear what viewing quality optimization Netflix might have been implementing, but the fact the company also shut down AirPlay support for the Apple TV suggests there might be a little more to the move.  For most iPhone and iPad users, the Netflix move shouldn't be a big deal. The native Netflix app on the Apple TV still works. Anyone who bought a new Samsung TV when it was announced as the first brand to get built-in AirPlay 2 support won't be able to cast Netflix from an iOS app, but smart TVs all have built-in Netflix support these days. The Netflix move largely means inconvenience. Killing Netflix AirPlay support forces people to sign into TVs with their Netflix account instead of casting content to the TV with their iPhone. The NFLX action takes some of the wind out of Apple's move to bring AirPlay 2 support to a wide range of TVs . This was a big deal because for more than a decade AAPL has forced consumers to buy an Apple TV streamer if they wanted to cast content from their iPhone or iPad to a TV. And that move ties into a critical strategy: pump up services like the new Apple TV+ streaming video service . With iPhone sales down, boost revenue and keep Apple stock value growing by rapidly growing Services division revenue. Faced with revenue pressures of its own, NFLX has increasingly railed against Apple's efforts, from refusing to let iPhone users pay for a Netflix subscription through an app (thereby avoiding Apple's 30% cut) to refusing to participate in AAPL's streaming video service plans . Netflix told The Verge the move was "" not a business competition play "" but the timing is suspicious. As Apple's services move and Apple TV+ bring it closer to being an actual competitor for subscribers, the yanking of Netflix AirPlay support is just the latest move by NFLX that make things a little for difficult for Apple - intentionally or not. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s. The post Netflix Kills AirPlay Support, Bruising Apple's TV Ambitions appeared first on InvestorPlace .

94,"Shutterstock photo With an estimated $245 billion in cash on the balance sheet and another $76 billion in operating cash flow, there's not much Apple (AAPL) can't buy. Apple's cash alone, in fact, would rank it in the top ten of the most valuable companies in the S&P 500 index. In the company’s pursuit for growth in its services business, there are several M&A targets the iPhone maker should consider. We already know the company has had ambitions of making a splash in media business. Time Warner was once believed to be in Apple's crosshairs, according to the Financial Times. Citing three people who were briefed on the possible M&A interest, the FT reported a top Apple executive raised the prospect of buying Time Warner at a recent meeting. With talks yielding no agreement, AT&T (T) swooped in and closed the deal. ""We would definitely buy something larger than we bought thus far,"" CEO Tim Cook has been quoted as saying to years ago. Cook qualified his statement by saying any deal Apple considers would have to fit strategically with the company’s business from the standpoint of “great technology and great people.” It’s for this reason I believe Apple should go after streaming a company like Netflix (NFLX) — an argument I’ve raised on more than one occasion. This deal would make sense on many levels, namely from the fact that Apple is hungry for content partnerships. The company is fresh from unveiling its own standalone streaming video content service. Apple’s transition into a fully-fledged services company has been ramped up. And Netflix would make it easier for Apple to offer a wide range of content to consumers. The company's premium streaming video service called Apple TV+ is perceive as an attack on Netflix. But it doesn’t have to be. Netflix is here to stay. Apple’s entry served to confirm what a great business model Netflix has. Instead of competing with Netflix, Apple could quickly emerge as the world’s largest movie streaming service by acquiring Netflix. That said, with Netflix’s market cap at about $160 billion, on top of the premium Apple would pay for Netflix, this deal would not come cheap. Apple, which is not known for making big M&A deals, could spend $195 billion for Netflix, which includes a 21% premium and seal the deal. To date, the company’s biggest acquisition has been the $3.1 billion it paid for Beats Electronics in 2014. But while organic growth has been its main strategy, the fact that the company’s bread-and-butter iPhone business has begun to slow could (or should) spark a change in its approach to M&A. The other name Apple could consider is Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Apple’s recent unveiling of a gaming platform underscores the company’s interest in taking a bite out of the $140 billion gaming industry. Dubbed Apple Arcade, the service, which will allow gamers to start a game on one Apple device and continue it on another, will be subscription-based and will feature 100 new games exclusive solely to Apple. Acquiring Activision, a leader not only in gaming but also in esports, makes tons of sense for Apple. Even with a market cap of $36 billion, Apple wouldn’t have to spend its cash pile as it could buy Activision two times with just its cash flow alone. But while these deals make sense on many levels, will Apple, which has seen its stock fall 14% in the past six months, finally do what many investors have begged for over the years: make a big M&A splash?",Richard Saintvilus,"April 08, 2019, 09:27:30 AM EDT",Should Apple (AAPL) Pivot From Its M&A Strategy?
