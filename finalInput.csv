1," April 5 (Reuters) - Representatives of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido have asked a U.S. court to overturn a prior ruling allowing Canadian miner Crystallex to seize part of U.S. refiner Citgo, which is owned by state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela. Guaido heads the opposition-controlled National Assembly and in January invoked the country's constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing President Nicolas Maduro's 2018 re-election was a fraud. The United States and most Western countries have recognized him as the country's rightful leader. Last year, a judge ruled Crystallex could seize shares in Citgo and auction them in its bid to get paid on a $1.4 billion award tied to the 2008 nationalization of its gold mining operations by the now cash-strapped South American country. ""Such an auction would not just be unseemly; it would be dangerous, undermining U.S. foreign policy by impeding President Guaido's ability to complete the transition of the Republic to democracy,"" the attorneys with Washington law firm Arnold & Porter wrote in a brief dated April 3. Guaido named a board of directors to Citgo in February, a move he described as ""protecting our assets."" Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled Guaido's representatives could request a stay, and gave them until this week to present their arguments. Maduro, a socialist who says he is the victim of an attempted U.S.-led coup, has accused the opposition of trying to ""steal"" Citgo.",,"April 05, 2019, 06:23:00 PM EDT",Lawyers for Venezuela's Guaido ask U.S. court to protect Citgo,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a filing, Petrobras, as the company is known, said the Engie consortium, which includes Canada's Caisse de Dépôt e Placement du Québec, presented an $8.6 billion bid for 90 percent of the TAG gas pipeline unit in northern and northeastern Brazil. Two sources with knowledge of the matter said the difference between the bids was very small. The second highest bid, delivered by EIG Global Energy Partners and Mubadala Investment Company, was less than 1 percent below Engie's bid, they said. Engie subsidiaries in different countries account for 75 percent of the winning consortium and the Canadian pension fund the other 25 percent, one of the sources added, asking for anonymity to discuss undisclosed details. Around 60 percent of the bid was financed by Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Banco Bradesco SA  and Banco do Brasil SA . The EIG-Mubadala group was financed by JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Goldman Sachs. The third group, led by Brazilian holding Itausa Investimentos Itau SA, was also financed also by local banks. Banco Santander Brasil SA  was Petrobras adviser on the deal. The price tag includes the payment by the Engie group of $800 million in debts to Brazilian state development bank BNDES. At an exchange rate of 3.85 reais to $1, Petrobras said, the deal values all of TAG at 35.1 billion reais. The divestment represents a victory for current Petrobras leadership and Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who is pushing to aggressively unload assets in a bid to cut debt and refocus on exploration and production. The sale process began in October 2017 but was interrupted last year by a Supreme Court injunction. In September 2016, Petrobras sold a larger gas network pipeline, Nova Transportadora do Sudeste, for $5.2 billion to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP, which beat out a bid by Engie.

7," By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on Russia to pull its troops from Venezuela and warned that ""all options"" were open to make that happen. The arrival of two Russian air force planes carrying nearly 100 Russian troops outside Caracas on Saturday has escalated the political crisis in Venezuela. ""Russia has to get out,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, where he met with Guaido's wife, Fabiana Rosales. The U.S. government believes the Russian troops include special forces and cybersecurity personnel. Asked how he would make Russian forces leave, Trump said: ""We'll see. All options are open."" Russia has bilateral relations and agreements with Venezuela which it plans to honor, Russian Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said, in response to Trump's comments. ""It's not up to US to decide actions and fate of other countries. It's only up to the people of Venezuela and its only legitimate president Nicolas Maduro,"" Polyanskiy said on Twitter. Maduro, who retains control of state functions and the country's military, has said Guaido is a puppet of the United States. Rosales, a 26-year-old journalist and opposition activist, told Trump that Guaido was attacked on Tuesday, though she did not provide details. ""I fear for my husband's life,"" she said. She was accompanied by the wife and sister of Roberto Marrero, Guaido's chief of staff, who was arrested and detained last week.

They want to submerge us in eternal darkness. But let me tell you that there is light, and the light is here,"" Rosales told Pence. She is slated to meet U.S. first lady Melania Trump in Palm Beach on Thursday on a swing through South Florida, home to the largest community of Venezuelan exiles in the United States.

8," By David French NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Pipeline operator TransCanada Corp is exploring a potential sale of its Columbia Midstream unit in a deal that could value the business at about $1 billion, three sources aware of the matter said on Friday. TransCanada, based in Calgary, Alberta, is offloading parts of its infrastructure to help finance the $8 billion it has earmarked to spend on new projects in 2019, such as the high-profile Coastal GasLink system and the Keystone XL pipeline, which are likely to generate higher returns than these legacy assets. A spokesman for TransCanada declined to comment. Columbia Midstream's assets include four gathering systems and a pipeline in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, according to the company's website. The unit generates around $100 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization annually (EBITDA), and could be valued at a multiple of 10 times that amount, the three sources said. Private equity firms, infrastructure and pension funds have all viewed pipeline assets as attractive acquisitions because of their steady financial returns. TransCanada is working with an investment bank to assist it in the sale process. TransCanada is also selling a package of mineral rights in the same area, located in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States, which would raise further cash for the company, one of the sources said. Mineral rights grant the holder the ability to extract hydrocarbons from certain acreage, although the title to that land is held by another party. The mineral rights could be sold to the same buyer as the midstream unit, but if the company receives a better offer from another party, they could be sold separately, the source said.",,"April 05, 2019, 02:57:00 PM EDT",TransCanada explores sale of $1 bln Appalachian pipeline unit,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Staley is assuming oversight of the three Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) divisions, banking, markets and corporate bank, in a move he said would help improve overall returns to more than the 7 percent achieved in 2018. The Barclays CEO faces pressure from activist investor Edward Bramson, who is seeking a seat on the board of the bank to try and force it to shrink the underperforming investment banking business that Staley has championed. A Barclays spokesman said Throsby's departure was ""not linked in any way"" to the pressure from Bramson's Sherborne investment vehicle, which holds a 5.5 percent stake in the bank. Barclays hired Throsby, who like Staley came from JP Morgan, in September 2016 after a six-month search for the vital job overseeing the bank's trading and advisory businesses.

10," By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday rejected Expedia Inc's  request for an injunction that would have required United Airlines to continue providing fare data for flights after Sept. 30, when the companies' contract ends. U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said Expedia had shown a ""likelihood of success"" on the merits of its breach of contract claim, but did not show a preliminary injunction was needed to avoid irreparable harm or serve the public interest. ""We welcome the ruling from the judge in favor of United which will minimize the risk of disrupting our customers' travel plans and ensure we can effectively serve customers who need to make changes to their itineraries purchased through Expedia,"" United said in an emailed statement. Expedia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The dispute came as some carriers try to reduce distribution costs by encouraging travelers to book directly rather than through online travel agencies such as Bellevue, Washington-based Expedia. Southwest Airlines Co  has long relied on direct bookings, and JetBlue Airways Corp  in October 2017 pulled its fares from several online agencies. Expedia accused United of trying to force a renegotiation of their 2011 contract by threatening to withhold fares for flights after Sept. 30, leaving it unable to book or change tickets. United countered that limiting fare listings would benefit travelers flying later, because the companies' ""coming divorce"" would leave Expedia unable to serve them. In his decision, Castel found no language in the contract between Expedia and United suggesting that United would withhold fare information in the final months, and no evidence that Expedia would be unable to service customers through Sept. 30. But he also found no proof that maintaining the ""contractual status quo"" would irreparably harm Expedia, even if the dispute led to customer confusion and hurt its reputation. Castel also said the public interest did not weigh in favor of a preliminary injunction. ""There is no serious issue as to the ability of members of the public to fly on their airline of their choosing,"" he wrote.

Huawei has strongly rejected the allegations and launched a lawsuit against the U.S. government. ""And that of course leads to more discussions with customers for us, but we can't see that contracts are being allocated. That has not happened yet."" EU nations will be required to share data on 5G cybersecurity risks and produce measures to tackle them by the end of the year, the European Commission said on Tuesday, shunning U.S. calls to ban Huawei across the bloc. ""It's good that the EU is trying to harmonize the regulations...they are trying to create some kind of umbrella, which I think is very good for Europe,"" Ekholm said, adding that Ericsson will not take a position on national security issues. Ericsson won back a 5G customer from Huawei in its own backyard last week when it signed a comprehensive deal with Denmark's TDC to deploy its 5G platform and modernize the carrier's radio access and core networks. Huawei had signed a six-year networks deal with TDC back in 2013, establishing the Danish company as a 'reference' customer to showcase its performance. TDC CEO Allison Kirkby was quoted as saying that the operator ""is not blind"" to widespread concerns about Huawei and information security, although she also pointed out that price was a significant factor.

18," By Matt Scuffham NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank  said it was open to further restructuring of its U.S. investment bank after Commerzbank  executives sought clarity on its plans during merger talks, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The future of the bank's U.S. trading and investment banking presence had already been in question, with some shareholders calling for further cuts on top of ones announced last year. Speculation has intensified following confirmation of the merger talks last month. Commerzbank wanted reassurances Deutsche Bank was prepared to make deeper cuts at its loss-making U.S. business as a condition of proceeding with the merger talks, the sources said. The two banks have been in discussions on the potential deal over the past three weeks and a decision on whether to intensify or terminate the discussions is expected as early as this weekend, the sources said. It is unclear how many of the bank's 10,000 strong U.S. employees would be affected by any new cuts. Last year, the bank said it would reduce its global headcount to below 90,000 from 97,000. That included a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs, including a significant number in New York. In a research note published on Friday, analysts at KBW said Deutsche Bank could cut up to 15 percent of its investment banking staff globally, equivalent to around 2,500 jobs, to achieve cost savings required to make the deal work. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both declined to comment. David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management, said he thinks the majority of the cuts would be outside Germany. ""If you want to reduce the pain for the staff in Germany, you have to cut more in New York and, maybe, London also. Deutsche Bank does not have a competitive advantage in investment banking in the United States,"" he said. Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Christian Sewing, said in a memo to staff last month the bank aimed to remain a global bank with a strong capital markets business. Commerzbank's chief executive, Martin Zielke, believes a strong and focused investment bank would be a good addition to the lender, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The German government, which has pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion, wants the combined business to retain an investment bank capable of supporting German companies doing business around the world, the sources said. A tie-up between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank would give the combined bank a dominant position in its domestic market and improve its cost of funding. However, some analysts believe the deal fails to address Deutsche Bank's biggest problem, its underperforming and capital-intensive U.S. investment bank. Commerzbank has limited investment banking operations so there are few opportunities to generate cost savings in that part of the bank, leaving Deutsche Bank still striving to turn around a business that has weighed on its earnings. After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street, even as European rivals like Credit Suisse  made big cuts.",,"April 05, 2019, 01:06:00 PM EDT",Deutsche Bank open to U.S. revamp in merger talks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19," By Naomi Tajitsu YOKOHAMA, Japan, March 27 (Reuters) - An external committee reviewing governance at Nissan Motor Co  said on Wednesday there were enough facts to suspect violations of laws and the private use of company funds by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn. Following a three-month audit of Nissan's governance after  a scandal that shook the global auto industry, the committee put the blame squarely on what it called Ghosn's concentration of power. It also acknowledged Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa's role in Ghosn's salary arrangement at the heart of the scandal. The group issued 38 recommendations to bolster Nissan's governance, including that top executive positions at the Japanese carmaker should not be held by people serving in executive positions at Renault or junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp. It also proposed that the majority of directors, including the chairman of the board, be independent, outside directors and that the role of company chairman be abolished. The recommendations from the external, seven-member committee come weeks after Nissan and Renault said they would retool their alliance, one of the world's biggest automakers, to break up the all-powerful chairmanship previously held by Ghosn. ""There are facts sufficient to suspect violations of laws and regulations, violation of internal rules and private use of company funds and expenses... by Mr. Ghosn,"" the committee said in its report. It also singled out Nissan director Greg Kelly, who too has  been indicted, for his alleged role in helping Ghosn avoid oversight, and said that Saikawa had signed documents regarding compensation Ghosn would receive after retirement. ""It is clear that there are issues requiring improvement with respect to Nissan's governance as it could not prevent the misconduct."" Ghosn, who this month was released on $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days in a Tokyo detention centre, has called the charges against him ""meritless"". Kelly has also denied the charges. ""We expect Nissan will take these recommendations seriously and execute them in a swift manner to build the best possible governance structure,"" committee co-chair Seiichiro Nishioka told a briefing in Yokohama. At the briefing, the committee declined to comment on whether other individual directors - including Saikawa - should be held for responsible for failing to prevent the alleged actions by Ghosn.  MERGER TALKS? Nishioka also told the briefing that the capital structure between Nissan and Renault was a matter for the companies, and it was not appropriate for the committee to get involved. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Renault intends to restart merger talks with Nissan within 12 months, after which it will set sight on a bid to buy Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The plans signal a return to the strategies supported by Ghosn, who held talks about merging Renault with Fiat Chrysler two to three years ago, the Financial Times, which cited sources familiar with the matter, adding the French government had opposed the move. Nissan has said that too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, one of the most feted executives in the global auto industry who orchestrated Nissan's financial recovery in the early 2000s and created the blueprint for the automaking alliance between Nissan and Renault. At the time of his arrest in Tokyo in November on financial misconduct allegations, Ghosn held the chairmanship at Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which together form one of the world's biggest automakers selling roughly 10 million vehicles each year, while also serving as Renault CEO. Nissan's board currently comprises nine directors including the chairman, three of whom are categorised as outside, independent directors. Two directors, including one outside director, formerly served senior vice president roles at Renault. In a statement, Nissan said that its board of directors would review the committee's proposals ""with the greatest attention as soon as possible"".

20," By Marcelo Rochabrun SAO PAULO, April 5 (Reuters) - A new plan by cash-strapped carrier Avianca Brasil to sell its most coveted airport slots to Brazil's two largest airlines will draw intense antitrust scrutiny, which may delay or derail a pressing cash injection. Antitrust regulator CADE said on Friday that it could block the plan, which Avianca Brasil hopes could raise some $210 million later this month. The airline filed for bankruptcy protection in December. Representatives for LATAM, Avianca Brasil and Gol did not respond to requests for comment. Avianca Brasil's plan would raise much-needed funds but is high-risk, lawyers said, and could leave it hanging without quick cash. Creditors will vote later on Friday whether to approve the plan which would allow Gol and LATAM to bid on the assets. Avianca Brasil would not receive any funds until CADE greenlights the operation, said antitrust lawyer Tatiana Lins Cruz in an interview on Thursday. She said CADE could take up to eight months to analyze a case in which buyers already control more than 20 percent of a given market. Meanwhile, the airline would have to continue operations with its own money. But Avianca Brasil has been so cash-strapped  that it fell behind its payroll in March. A person familiar with LATAM's thinking said the airlines hoped CADE would approve the deals because they only involve a modest increase in their presence at Brazil's busiest airports.  AZUL SIDELINED The new plan is a setback for rival Azul SA, which ranks as Brazil's third largest airline and has a small presence in those three airports. In Sao Paulo's domestic Congonhas airport, Gol and LATAM already control a combined 92 percent of the slots, whereas Azul has just 3 percent. Azul had struck a preliminary deal with Avianca Brasil to take over the slots for $105 million and had already provided some $8 million so the carrier could meet its March payroll. But that deal was off once Gol and LATAM came in. CADE appeared to take a more positive view of an Azul takeover on Friday. ""A scenario where Azul becomes the buyer represents a lower antitrust concern than in a scenario with LATAM or Gol,"" the regulator said in its report. The plan could also draw scrutiny from Brazil's civil aviation regulator, because airport slots are not meant to be bought and sold. Azul was planning to buy Avianca Brasil's assets as a single airline, but the new plan would create seven different companies, each holding little more than slots.",,"April 05, 2019, 01:00:00 PM EDT","Gol, LATAM bids for Avianca Brasil assets may hit antitrust snag",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

22," By Roberta Rampton CALEXICO, Calif., April 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday promised approximately 450 miles (725 km) of new ""wall"" along the southern U.S. border, after threatening to slap Mexico with an unspecified economic penalty to crack down on what he describes as a crisis of undocumented immigration and drug trafficking. Referring to a ""colossal surge"" of immigrants, Trump convened a discussion with immigration officials and local leaders in Calexico on the U.S.-Mexico border just north of the much larger city of Mexicali. ""Our country is full,"" Trump said in a warning to migrants. ""Can't take you anymore. The Republican president's latest pronouncements, including a threat to impose auto tariffs on Mexico, are in response to a rising number of migrants, many of them families with children, traveling northward from Central America through Mexico and to the U.S. border. During Friday's discussion in Calexico, Trump was handed a diamond-shaped piece of steel slate - the material used to construct barriers along the border. Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said that by the end of next year - just after the November 2020 presidential election - about 450 miles (725 km) of new barrier will be completed. Border officials have said they need 722 miles (1,162 km) of new or replacement barriers. Trump is counting on seizing funds from other federal accounts and shifting them for the construction, a move being challenged in federal court because Congress has not given approval. Democrats generally oppose Trump's wall proposal, suggesting instead other types of enhanced border security that they argue would be more effective and less costly. Hammering on a favorite theme, Trump earlier on Friday said he was considering imposing an unspecified economic penalty on Mexico unless it helps alleviate the United States' drug and immigrant flows. Although Trump has several times linked the issues of illegal immigration and drug smuggling as he tries to tighten border security, much of the drug trade is not carried out by migrants but by professional crime gangs that send narcotics to the United States in vehicles through official ports of entry. Praising Mexico for moving recently against drug traffickers, Trump said, ""If they continue that, everything will be fine. If they don't we're going to tariff their cars at 25 percent."" ""Also, I'm looking at an economic penalty for all of the drugs that are coming in through the southern border and killing our people,"" Trump told reporters in Washington before departing for southern California.  TRUMP THREATS Trump said the drug-related tariff would supplant provisions of a trade deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as USMCA, which has not been approved by Congress. In a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump repeated a threat to close the border if Mexico ""stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from..."" ""I am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border. Over 100,00 Americans die each year, sooo many families destroyed!"" the president tweeted. It was not immediately clear what other penalties he was considering. The White House did not respond to a request for elaboration. It also was unclear where Trump got the $500 billion figure. Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said the amount of drugs smuggled into the United States annually was probably in the range of $50-$60 billion. He emphasized that it was fueled by U.S. demand. ""He's blaming Mexico for our drug problem,"" Vigil said, adding that his words could hurt bilateral cooperation in battling drug-trafficking. ""The president should focus on reducing the demand and facilitating drug treatment centers here in the United States,"" he added. In recent days, Mexico has taken a more rigorous approach to interviewing and registering immigrants from Central America, Haiti and Cuba, according to officials. Previously, the Mexican government freely handed out humanitarian visas with the goal of allowing people to stay and work legally in Mexico. But it backed away from that policy after a surge in those requesting the documents and amid criticism from Washington. On Thursday, a Mexican federal police plane flew dozens of Haitians home.

26,"Apple (AAPL) is no longer about iPhones, and while iPhone sales figures have stubbornly continued to shape investor sentiment, the plan was always a monumental shifting of gears to services, which promises to be much bigger than devices down the road. Now it’s about streaming, and it’s even about a new Apple Credit Card, both unveiled yesterday at a high-profile Apple event. The rule of thumb is that when Apple enters any space, everybody is watching. But this time, Apple’s debut into streaming isn’t about transforming the market—it’s about mission creep, and in some cases, it’s about playing catch-up (like it did with its  music  service, Apple Music). At a press event Monday afternoon, Apple management  announced  the fall launch of its paid, ad-free video portal for its own original movies and TV shows called  Apple TV+ . Apple has not yet revealed a price for it or said exactly how many shows it will have at launch  but some analyst estimates have  indicated  that it could be slightly more expensive than the cheapest Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video subscriptions, which are all around $8 per month. While Apple will reportedly spend some  $1 billion  on its own content, its streaming service is more of a Trojan Horse that will bring together a handful of existing services, including HBO, Starz, and Showtime as well. How has recruitment gone so far? So, so. The Apple TV app will support over 150 streaming apps, including Amazon Prime and Hulu, as well as DIRECTV NOW and PlayStation Vue. But  Netflix  isn’t playing ball. In 2006, Apple was actually one of the  first  to offer paid-for videos on its iTunes, but then things stalled, and now it’s entering an already-crowded streaming market. Netflix, meanwhile, has more than 148 million  subscribers  globally, followed by  Amazon  with more than 100 million people subscribed to its Prime service. Other streaming services such as Hulu are relatively small by comparison, but even they have some 25 million  subscribers  in the U.S. Most recently,  NBC  announced its own streaming service, which could launch as early as May. Disney  and Warner Media are also due to launch streaming platforms later this year. And just last week, Disney concluded a $71.3-billion  mega-merger  with Century Fox. The big question is whether Apple lagged behind on purpose. After all, one of the most annoying aspects of all the streaming services is that customers have to have multiple accounts to watch everything they want. They’ve been waiting for someone to come in and bring it all under a single umbrella. Will that be Apple? Well, not yet—and not without Netflix. But it’s worth keeping in mind that even though competition is strong and established, Apple has an extremely  loyal  customer base. Also, while Apple it is hoping to attract some of its competitors' subscribers, there are millions of newcomers in the form of ex-cable users. The Wall Street Journal recently  reported  that more than three million customers in the US canceled their cable TV or satellite subscriptions in the last quarter of 2018, making that a total of 10 million since 2010. Apple Music, iTunes, and the App Store already make up almost 15 percent of the tech giant's  annual  revenues — some $37.2 billion in 2018. Apple has reportedly set a target of 100 million subscribers to its streaming service in the first five years. That could add $7 billion to $10 billion to its annual revenues. Aside from streaming, Apple also  announced it was overhauling its news app, called  Apple News+.  The app is adding more than 300 magazine subscriptions for a monthly subscription price of $9.99.  The New York Times and the Washington Post, which have higher-priced  monthly subscription programs, reportedly will not be part of the service. And there’s more, still: The tech giant has also introduced its own credit card, Apple Card , which will come out this summer and will be linked to Goldman Sachs. It will feature both a digital version for Apple devices and a physical card for when Apply Pay isn’t accepted. All of this may not seem enormously disruptive, but Trojan Horses aren’t immediately obvious, as history has demonstrated.

27," SHANGHAI, March 27 (Reuters) - Chinese regulators are urging brokerages to pay strong attention to risks in their bond repurchase, or repo, businesses, after some borrowers failed to answer margin calls, two sources said on Wednesday. Ten institutions which borrow money using bonds as collateral in the repo business failed to increase deposits after margin calls were triggered, prompting five brokerages to use 242 million yuan ($36 million) worth of their own money to plug the hole, according the China Securities Investor Protection Fund Corp, supervised by China's securities watchdog. The Investor Protection fund warned that risks from frequent bond defaults could spread to the bond repo business, according to the source. Chinese regulators have issued a flurry of warnings in recent months over an apparent resurgence in riskier types of financial activity, as policymakers shift their focus from a debt clampdown to boosting the slowing economy. China's securities regulator announced measures on Monday to restrict convertible bond subscriptions after surging demand for the instruments, prompted by this year's stock market rally, raised concerns over market liquidity.

28," By Arno Schuetze FRANKFURT, April 5 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank  and Commerzbank  favour a straightforward merger over more complex ways to structure a deal, three people close to the matter said. In their base case scenario, a transaction would be organised as a share offer from Deutsche Bank for Commerzbank, they said. That structure is preferred to the creation of a new holding company, which is viewed as too difficult to execute. Sources said last year that Deutsche Bank was examining creating a holding company structure amid speculation at the time that it could merge with Commerzbank. Last month the two banks confirmed they were in talks about a merger. A preliminary decision on whether they want to go forward is expected within days. The people cautioned that no decision has yet been taken on a potential deal structure and there is still no certainty that a deal will be struck at all. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment. Regulators in the United States, Britain and Switzerland tend to favour the bank holding company structure, in part because it can help with the winding down of a troubled bank. There has been a push since the financial crash to make banks easier to break up, lowering the risk that the problems of a troubled investment bank, for instance, could affect ordinary savers. About 90 percent of U.S. banks, including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, operate as holding companies, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve. But converting to a holding company structure can be costly. In Deutsche and Commerzbank's case, defining the relative value of the two banks for a holding structure would be more complicated than simply negotiating a price for a simple takeover, the sources said. As part of a deal, Deutsche Bank will be asked by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds to plug capital holes resulting from asset revaluations and expected restructuring costs, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier this week. Issues around regulatory capital - and how to make use of the fact that Commerzbank trades well below book level, which can be used to boost such capital - are a talking point between the two banks.",,"April 05, 2019, 11:22:00 AM EDT","Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank favour takeover rather than holding company structure",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
29," By Tom Sims FRANKFURT, March 27 (Reuters) - Commerzbank's  chief executive was paid 32 percent less in 2018, contrasting with sharp rises for the top management at its potential merger partner Deutsche Bank. The disparity, revealed in Commerzbank's annual report on Wednesday, underscores a divide in the compensation culture of the German banking rivals, which are in talks over a merger. Commerzbank CEO Martin Zielke's total compensation for the year was 1.97 million euros  ($2.22 million), down from 2.88 million euros in 2017, compared with 7 million euros for Deutsche Bank's chief Christian Sewing. And pay for Commerzbank's management board dropped by 24 percent in 2018, while Deutsche Bank's board received total pay, including bonuses, of 55.7 million euros, up from 29.8 million euros a year earlier. Commerzbank, 15 percent owned by the government after a bailout a decade ago, focuses on individual retail customers and financing small-and-medium sized corporate clients. Deutsche Bank in contrast operates a sprawling global investment bank. The drop in management pay at Commerzbank comes despite its net profit rising to 865 million euros from 128 million a year earlier, although it scaled back revenue targets. Commerzbank's annual profit was more than twice the 341 million euros earned by Deutsche Bank. Commerzbank's bonus pool for the broader workforce declined 41 percent to 134 million euros from 229 million a year earlier. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both declined to comment.  TOO SMALL TO SCALE? Separately, Deutsche Bank supervisory board chairman Paul Achleitner said that the banks aim to announce more concrete steps on the merger by late April. Achleitner, speaking at a conference in Liechtenstein, said that a merger makes great sense from a macroeconomic perspective, but that the banks were still studying the operational value. ""Our problem may not be too big to fail, but rather too small to scale,"" Achleitner said. ""Size matters."" The prospect of a merger is facing heightened opposition from Commerzbank employees. The bank's workers' council sent a letter to board members on Wednesday to protest the merger, saying the idea lacked support among workers, customers and society. ""We are of the opinion that you will fall into an uncontrollable adventure without a solid plan, without a vision and without support,"" the letter said.",,"March 27, 2019, 07:01:00 AM EDT",Commerzbank management pay cuts contrast with Deutsche Bank,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

31," By Elizabeth Dilts and Anna Irrera NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's  credit card deal with Apple Inc  is the latest move by the Wall Street investment bank to court mass-market consumers, potentially connecting Goldman with hundreds of millions of iPhone users. But Goldman is entering a crowded market for co-branded cards where retailers often have the upper hand, and analysts question how much tolerance its shareholders will have for growing the bank's fledgling consumer business through credit card lending. Apple and Goldman did not disclose the economic terms of their partnership when it was announced on Monday. But banks have been increasingly willing to take less favorable deals because post-financial crisis regulations make the credit card business attractive for lenders, which are required to hold less capital against such debt than against other assets. ""As this kind of benign credit environment continues retailers have a greater leverage than they had a few years ago,"" said a person involved in similar credit card deals. Issuing banks retain control of approving customers for  cards, often using data the retailer has on shoppers as part of the process, the person said. Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said in an email to employees on Monday that the card is a ""major step"" in the bank's plan to grow its consumer business. Solomon has said the consumer business is a critical part of the bank's strategy to grow revenues and cut costs, as revenue shrinks in traditional areas of strength for Goldman like bond trading. But many investors have been uneasy with Goldman growing its unsecured consumer debt, especially at a time when many speculate that a recession could be looming, said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. Marcus now has $45 billion in customer deposits in the United States and the U.K., and has issued $5 billion in personal loans, according to Solomon's email. While the amount of loans is small compared to the bank's overall balance sheet, Hawken said investors would likely prefer Goldman stick to using its consumer business to add deposits, as opposed to personal loans or credit card debt. ""People want Goldman to be Goldman,"" Hawken said. Goldman declined comment for this article. The Apple Card's wide interest rate range indicates that some customers might have lower credit scores, said Josh Siegel, chief executive of StoneCastle Financial Corp. However, the bank may not necessarily keep that risk on its books. ""They might securitize the debt, which wouldn't be anything new for an investment bank,"" Siegel said. ""I can't imagine that Goldman Sachs, all of a sudden, especially with where we are in the credit cycle, is going to go long on unsecured consumer debt."" As this is Goldman's first foray into credit cards, it may take the bank a year or two to assess the quality of its credit decisions, according to an industry expert who declined to be named. The same person said that the stated range of possible interest rates on unpaid balances was too wide to clearly show how much credit risk Goldman expects to take. Credit risk concerns aside, analysts said that Goldman's decision to launch its first credit card in partnership with one of the world's biggest companies gives it the opportunity to gain consumer market share. While Apple says its card is ""created by Apple, not a bank,"" according to its website, the Goldman Sachs logo will appear on the back of the card. ""For Goldman this is a play for massive distribution without having to contort too much,"" said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy and partner at Autonomous Research.",,"March 27, 2019, 07:00:00 AM EDT",Goldman's Apple pairing furthers bank's mass-market ambitions,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

33," By Karen Pierog CHICAGO, March 26 (Reuters) - Yield-hungry investors on Tuesday snapped up more than $1.1 billion of general obligation bonds offered by Illinois and Chicago, two of the U.S. municipal market's most financially troubled issuers. While the state and its largest city continued to pay a high price for their fiscal woes, their deals benefited from low supply in the $3.8 trillion market and ""a ton of cash"" looking for bonds to buy, according to Greg Saulnier, a Municipal Market Data (MMD) analyst. Shaun Burgess, a portfolio manager at Cumberland Advisors,  agreed. ""Clearly, demand is discounting some of the credit risks associated with these issuers,"" he said. MMD narrowed so-called credit spreads for Illinois, the lowest-rated U.S. state, at a notch or two above junk, due to its huge unfunded pension liability and chronic structural budget deficit, in the wake of a $440 million bond sale. The state's spreads remain the widest among U.S. states. Chicago, which is also struggling with pension funding and deficits, increased the size of its bond offering to nearly $728 million and moved pricing up by a day. There was enough demand to allow underwriters to lower yields by 5 basis points in most maturities through a repricing. Bank of America Merrill Lynch beat out eight other bidders for Illinois'$300 million of taxable bonds and 13 other bidders for $140 million of tax-exempt bonds, according to the state. Yields on the tax-free refunding bonds topped out at 3.60 percent in 2028 with a 5 percent coupon. MMD narrowed Illinois spreads over its scale by 1 to 10 basis points with the spread for bonds due in 2028 shrinking 1 basis point to 182. The refunding also resulted in a $10.6 million present value savings, the state reported. Yields reached 6 percent in 2044 for Illinois' taxable bonds. Proceeds from that deal will help fund a pension benefit buyback program the state launched last year. Neene Jenkins, a vice president and municipal credit analyst at AllianceBernstein, said the bonds were priced much tighter than where the city's bonds had been trading in the secondary market. She added, however, that Tuesday's pricing ""is reflective of a credit that is in distress.""",,"March 27, 2019, 07:00:00 AM EDT",Investors grab hefty yields in Illinois and Chicago bond sales,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

35," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Apple (NADAQ: AAPL ) have a complicated relationship. They are often rivals, but at the same time they rely on each other in some ways. That relationship has been adversarial in the past, but recently thawed when Amazon began carrying Apple devices and its Echo smart speakers picked up the ability to play Apple Music. Now AMZN is reportedly coming after one of Apple's most successful products - AirPods - with its own Alexa wireless earbuds. When they are released, it may just mark a point where the relationship between the two companies turns cold again…  Amazon's secretive Lab126 hardware division has turned out some very popular devices, including the Kindle e-readers, Fire TV tablets and Amazon Echo smart speakers. When word leaks that the Lab126 is working on a product, the impact to the target market can be immediate - and it's usually bad news for existing players. Last year, when word got out that Lab126 was working on what turned out to be the Fire TV Recast (a live TV recorder), Tivo (NASDAQ: TIVO ) stock took a 4.3% hit on the news . Late yesterday, Bloomberg published a report saying that Amazon's Lab126 is currently working on Alexa wireless earbuds that are intended to take on Apple's popular AirPods . According to Bloomberg's sources, they will look like the AirPods and function in a similar fashion to the AirPods, but with Alexa instead of Siri. Users will be able to use Alexa for hands-free music control, to ask questions and of course to order products online. However, it sounds as though AMZN is intending to make its own offering even more compelling than AirPods by targeting superior audio quality - one of the key complaints about the AirPods. That strategy would be somewhat ironic, given one of the key selling points of Apple's HomePod smart speaker is that it offers superior audio to Amazon's Alexa smart speakers. The HomePod was far more expensive than an Echo but given Amazon's strategy of offering hardware at or near cost, the Alexa wireless earbuds are expected to instead undercut Apple's pricing. Unlike Tivo, Apple stock didn't reflect any investor concern about this news. That may change if Amazon's offering is a hit, instead of the miss that Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Pixel Buds turned out to be . There is definitely some money to made in selling wireless earbuds. The devices are popular and becoming more so as smartphone manufacturers increasingly eliminate headphone jacks. They are expected to be a $10 billion market by 2023 , and at the moment, Apple's AirPods hold about 60% of that market.  AAPL is counting on wearables like the Apple Watch and the AirPods to help take some of the heat of slowing iPhone sales off Apple stock. For Amazon, the prospect of capturing a chunk of wireless earbud market likely wouldn't have a material impact on its bottom line, especially if the company follows its pattern of selling them without regard to making a profit. The key to the Alexa wireless earbuds is Alexa. Shut out of smartphones, Amazon snuck its personal assistant into contention by putting it in its Echo Smart speakers. The Echo got Alexa into the home, and Alexa wireless earbuds offer a sneaky way to take Alexa mobile. With billions of Android and iOS smartphones out there - the vast majority of them using Google Assistant and Siri instead of downloading Amazon's Alexa app - a pair of really good sounding, affordable wireless earbuds could be the Trojan Horse that finally gets AMZN's Alexa onto smartphones in a meaningful way. That would mean Alexa gets ""smarter"" thanks to machine learning applied to the increased usage. More importantly for Amazon stock, it would translate into more customers buying Prime memberships to listen to Amazon Prime Music, and it would result in more online purchases thanks to the convenience of having Alexa in your ear everywhere you go. However, if they are successful, Alexa wireless earbuds will inevitably turn into a friction point between Apple and Amazon. AirPods are one of AAPL's big success stories and the company talks them up whenever possible. Bloomberg says the Alexa wireless earbuds are expected in the second half of the year, setting up a showdown between Amazon and Apple just in time for the holiday shopping season - when earbuds are a hot gifting commodity. That battle for holiday sales could also mark the point where the AAPL and AMZN relationship chills once again. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

37,"The technology sector is littered with emerging themes and corresponding exchange traded funds (ETFs) that offer tactical investors compelling long-term potential. A prime example of a booming theme buoyed by favorable fundamentals is cloud computing, which is accessible in basket form via the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY). The $2.09 billion SKYY turns eight years old in July and tracks the cap-weighted ISE Cloud Computing Index. While cloud computing has been receiving increased attention in recent years, it is still a relatively new industry group within the broader technology sector. Said another way, cloud computing as an industry is not as old as, say, semiconductors or traditional software. As such, there are some qualifiers that are part of SKYY's underlying index. For instance, the index allows for the inclusion of three types of companies: dedicated cloud providers, non-pure play cloud companies and technology conglomerates. An example of a dedicated cloud company would be VMware (VMW), SKYY's second-largest holding; while an example of a non-dedicated company with some cloud exposure would be Facebook (FB), SKYY's sixth-largest holding. A technology conglomerate would be a company such as IBM (IBM), which is also a SKYY constituent. SKYY conglomerate exposure is defined as follows: “technology Conglomerate Cloud Computing Companies: Large broad-based companies that indirectly utilize or support the use of cloud computing technology.” The fund's index caps exposure to those companies at 10%. The Cloud = Growth Going beyond the mechanics of SKYY, the growth trajectory of the cloud business is what sets the table for this ETF. “The worldwide public cloud services market is projected to grow 17.3 percent in 2019 to total $206.2 billion, up from $175.8 billion in 2018,” according to Gartner, Inc. Cloud application software, also known as software as a service or SaaS, underpins the growth of cloud computing, but other corners of the market are emerging as credible revenue drivers. “The fastest-growing segment of the market is cloud system infrastructure services (infrastructure as a service or IaaS), which is forecast to grow 27.6 percent in 2019 to reach $39.5 billion, up from $31 billion in 2018,” said Gartner.  Courtesy: Gartner, Inc. Cloud-related investment opportunities are spread across multiple corners of the communication services and technology sectors. SKYY reflects as much as the cloud ETF features exposure to 27 stocks from eight industry groups. Underscoring the point that the cloud is big business for big technology companies, the median market capitalization of SKYY's holdings is $49.13 billion. A prime example of a mega-cap technology company with significant cloud exposure is Microsoft (MSFT), which is a 2.41% weight in SKYY. ""We estimate Azure (Microsoft’s cloud business) is approximately a $7 billion business and it still grew by a staggering 76% year over year in the December quarter,” said Morningstarin a recent note. “The battle for cloud supremacy has become a two-horse race between Azure and AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Azure is well-positioned given its installed base at enterprise customers with Server, Database, Dynamics, and Office. Enterprise clients are increasingly adopting a hybrid cloud environment, which plays into Microsoft’s strong position, as the company can offer customers their existing environment in either public cloud or on premise flavors.” Bottom Line Past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but over the past three years, SKYY has easily outperformed broader, traditional technology indexes and ETFs with less annualized volatility. Bolstering the long-term case for cloud stocks and SKYY is cloud computing's intersection with an array of disruptive, emerging technologies, such artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and healthcare innovation.",Todd Shriber,"March 26, 2019, 03:29:33 PM EDT",An ETF With Sky-High Potential,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1

39,"By Landon Manning The multitrillion-dollar banking titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is currently head-and-shoulders above competing banking firms in hiring blockchain industry specialists, Forbes reported last month. As jobs-listing website Indeed.com revealed, over the past year, JPMorgan Chase was the only financial firm in the top ten companies that posted jobs containing the words “blockchain,” “cryptocurrency” or “bitcoin.” Forbes went on to note that the only companies to post more jobs in these fields were those directly working in the tech industry, like IBM and Cisco, accounting firms like Deloitte and EY, or blockchain builders like ConsenSys and Microsoft. In February, JPMorgan unveiled its plans to launch JPM Coin, “to use blockchain to simplify payments between its clients,” after building a platform on the Ethereum blockchain “designed to let enterprises capitalize on the benefits of using a shared ledger similar to bitcoin’s blockchain, but with more control over privacy and faster speeds.” Andrew Flowers, an economist at Indeed.com, analyzed blockchain hiring trends and said, “It’s notable that there’s a lack of financial and banking companies hiring for something that’s made to replace money,” and that the site is currently seeing more postings than job searches in blockchain-related fields. Flowers also said that “job-seeker interest has collapsed because it tracks the price of bitcoin” and therefore “is as volatile as the price of bitcoin.” Regardless of the interest that qualified people have in filling these jobs, however, the continued pace of job postings could yield interesting insights into the state of major firms’ relationship to distributed ledger technology. Forbes specifically drew attention to “the recent increase in the number of large companies exploring non-cryptocurrency applications of blockchain,” attempting to mimic the advantages of this same technology that allows money transfers without the use of a bank as a middleman. Indeed.com reported that since 2016, related job postings to the site have increased by 4,086 percent, while job searches have increased by 553 percent, prompting initiatives to try and train new talent to fill in this gap. Forbes stated that the vast majority of these jobs are located in the “usual suspects” of major U.S. cities, taking place in national and regional tech hubs such as San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, New York City, Boston and others.",Bitcoin Magazine,"April 05, 2019, 08:29:59 AM EDT",JPMorgan Leads Blockchain Hiring as Job Openings Ramp Up,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

41,"Shutterstock photo Cash is cumbersome, dirty and increasingly too tangible for our digital desires. And while we’ve already given it up to a fair extent for the credit and debit card--it still means we have to wait in lines, and that’s so 1990s.  In an effort to cut costs and avoid long lines in front of the cash register, a small-but-growing number of retailers have stopped accepting paper currency entirely. Over the past couple of years, some retail stores and restaurants in large cities have simply ceased cash operations. But the problem is that while it may be safer and more convenient to pay without cash, banning the use of cash could be discriminating against low-income individuals without credit or bank accounts because of the fees and minimum balance requirements.  In fact, local and state governments are rather up in arms about the whole thing. Earlier this month, the  Philadelphia City Council passed a bill making it the first major city to ban cashless payments. New Jersey, Now New York City, Washington, San Francisco and Chicago are now all weighing similar bills. ""With a 26-percent poverty rate in Philadelphia, the mayor believes in equal opportunity for all,'' city spokesman  Mike Dunn  said in an emailed statement to USA Today. “It is important to recognize the fact that not everyone has access to banks or lines of credit,” the New York Times cited State Senator  Nellie Pou , one of the sponsors of the bill in New Jersey, as saying. Going cashless is inevitable, but much of the country isn’t ready for that just yet. This was mostly expressed in Philadelphia where more than one-quarter (some 400,000 people) live below the poverty line, according to a  Pew Charitable Trusts report  from last year. With $19,700 a year for an adult with two children at home these families lack access to credit cards. For New Yorkers who don’t want to wait in line anymore, it’s important to consider that despite some of our penchants for going fully digital, we are still largely a cash society. A  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report  from 2017 shows that 6.5 percent of the U.S. households were ""unbanked""; in other words, households in which no individual has a checking or savings account. Another 18.7 percent of households were categorized as “underbanked”. And while those rates are declining all the time, they are still some large hurdles to a cashless society. It’s also worth noting that cash was the most frequently used payment instrument in 2017, accounting for 30 percent of all payments. Credit and debit cards were used in 48 percent of consumer transactions in 2017, of which 27 percent went to debit and 21 percent to credit card payments, according to the    Federal Reserve report  from the fall. Still, financial institutions are using every weapon in their arsenal to fight against cash because their customers are the ones who want to go cashless. Visa  has been offering $10,000 each to as many as 50 restaurants and food vendors to pay for their technology and marketing costs in return for a pledge to go cashless. And e-commerce giant Amazon, for its part, came out in opposition to the New Jersey bill to ban cashless retail outlets. After all, it has five cashless and cashier-less pop-up stores and one bookstore there. Now it’s lobbying local governments who are considering their own ban on  Amazon  automated stores. There are only a small number of Amazon Go stores in operation today, but the company was planning to open as many as 3,000 locations by 2021, according to  Bloomberg . Now it might have jumped the gun as local and state governments worry about discrimination and poverty.

The Roku CEO says that the tech company is launching its streaming service on other platforms to better reach a wide market. He claims that the company needs to do this if they want it to be a success. This is is due to the company's set-top box not having a large share of the market at about 15%. Stores Closing : Apple is indeed planning to close down two stores in Texas , reports 9to5Mac . The closings will be for the company's stores in Frisco and Plano locations. These stores will be closing their doors on April 12. The exact reason for the closings are unknown, but it might have to do with the company trying to avoid lawsuits from patent trolls.

43," By Collin Eaton HOUSTON, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is set to speak in Houston on Friday carrying a tough message against Venezuela's government to an expatriate community eager for more actions to oust the country's president, Nicolas Maduro. An estimated 50,000 Venezuelans live in greater Houston, the second-largest expat community outside of south Florida. Many support U.S. efforts to rid Venezuela of Maduro, having fled the socialist politics of former leader Hugo Chavez for a home in Houston's energy industry. The Trump administration is considering new sanctions to sap the Maduro government of oil revenue, which provides 90 percent of the OPEC member nation's export income, White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said last week. Sanctions ""are making it difficult for Maduro. But those people will not get out without a big push from the international community,"" said Carlos Sanchez, a former employee of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA, who moved to Texas after Chavez fired thousands of oil workers in 2002. Sanchez lives in Katy, a dozen miles (20 kilometers) west of Houston's energy corridor where ConocoPhillips, BP America  and Venezuela'sCitgo Petroleum Corp  have local headquarters. Katy has so many expats, he said, it is sometimes called ""Katy-zuela. Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan native and Latin American energy expert at Rice, said many Houston expats want Pence to offer a plan to get the Venezuelan military to stop supporting Maduro. ""There's a lot of concern about ‘what's the plan now?'"" Monaldi said in an interview. ""It doesn't seem the military is willing to remove support from Maduro"" and accept Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is backed by the United States and most Western Hemisphere countries. Some anti-Maduro residents here believe sanctions are not enough. ""We want to see more than barking. We want to see action,"" said Miguel Eljuri, a Venezuelan living in Houston who also once worked for PDVSA. He and other expats interviewed this week said they wished the United States would form a military coalition to force Maduro out. Some said they would return to the Latin American nation under a new administration. ""There's a lot of people who would like to go there,"" said Luis Savcic, a former Venezuelan oil worker who joined Marathon Petroleum Corp  in Houston. ""Engineers, doctors, skilled labor should go back."" Some large oilfield service companies with operations in Venezuela have identified Venezuelan employees now outside the country who could help rebuild the nation's energy industry once a new administration is in office, Monaldi said.",,"April 05, 2019, 08:07:00 AM EDT",Houston's Venezuelan expats eager for more action against Maduro,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

45," By Naomi Tajitsu TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan  boss Carlos Ghosn is back in the Tokyo detention centre where he previously spent 108 days, after being released just last month on a $9 million bail. Prosecutors arrested the once-feted executive on fresh charges of financial misconduct on Thursday. His former employers, Japan'sNissan and France's Renault, initially appeared to be at odds over his case when he was first arrested in November, but now seem to have closed ranks against him.  WHAT ARE THE NEW ALLEGATIONS, HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT? Ghosn was arrested again on suspicion of funnelling $5 million from payments made by a Nissan subsidiary to a third party for personal gain. An internal Nissan investigation has identified the party as a Nissan distributor in Oman. He is already fighting charges of under-reporting his Nissan salary for nearly a decade through 2018, and a charge of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books during the global financial crisis around 2008. The new allegation is potentially more serious, as it could show that he used company funds for his own purposes. Renault too is investigating payments it made under Ghosn's watch to the same company in Oman. The outcome of that probe could deepen the French automaker's exposure to the scandal, which so far has been largely focused on Nissan.  HOW DOES THE NEW CHARGE AFFECT GHOSN'S TRIAL? Ghosn's lawyer has said the new charge will prolong his legal proceedings. It is, however, not clear how much more prison time he could face if charged and found guilty on the latest allegations. He already faces a maximum of 10 years and a 10 million yen($89,517.50) fine if found guilty of the current charges. Ghosn's trial is expected to start later this year.  HOW CAN GHOSN BE RE-ARRESTED WHEN ALREADY OUT ON BAIL? Arresting a suspect who has been released on bail is highly uncommon, and Japanese prosecutors have said they ""humbly"" recognised any international criticism over the latest arrest. But prosecutors also cited the concern that Ghosn could destroy evidence while out on bail as impetus for arrest. Legal experts say that re-arresting a suspect who has been released on bail suggests that prosecutors continue to look for new charges - and may be concerned about the chances of winning a guilty verdict with the current charges.  WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE GHOSN'S INITIAL ARREST? Since his November arrest on the tarmac of a Tokyo airport, Ghosn has faced a swell of allegations. Renault initially sought to avoid being drawn into the investigation initiated by Nissan - which ousted Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest - and for weeks avoided sharing the Japanese partner's findings with its own board. He was forced out as Renault chairman and CEO in January. Nissan has found that its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to the Omani distributor, while one source has told Reuters that the total sum paid by Renault is in the double-digit millions. Renault has also turned over evidence that the 50,000-euro($56,145) rental of Ghosn's Chateau de Versailles wedding in 2016 had been improperly charged to the company. Nissan's investigation has also revealed the purchase of several properties around the world, including a Beirut house, by the company for Ghosn's use. A joint audit of the Renault-Nissan BV alliance management organisation has tallied 1.2 million euros in Lebanese donations and other spending of questionable benefit to the car makers, among preliminary results presented to Renault directors. It has also been alleged that he used around $600,000 in Nissan funds to pay his children's university tuitions. Sources told Reuters this week that Renault had uncovered suspect payments to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman while Ghosn was CEO, which may be connected to the purchase of a luxury yacht worth millions of euros.  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Ghosn will remain in custody until April 14 after a court approved his detention. Prosecutors can apply for an additional 10 days detention, after which they must indict or release him. If indicted, Ghosn's legal team can apply, again, for bail.

46,"Shutterstock photo I have frequently, right here in these pages, pointed out that traders’ knee-jerk reactions to news and events can result in opportunities for investors of a more patient, thoughtful bent. The market’s immediate response to events is often more about expectations and positioning going into it than it is about the actual substance of an announcement, and that seemed to be the case yesterday as Apple (AAPL) revealed their suite of new services. The company announced three new subscription services, Apple TV+, Apple News+, and a new Apple Card. Traders’ disappointment presumably stems from the fact that two of the “new” services simply added a “+” to the names of existing ones. That is understandable in some ways but doesn’t really explain the roughly two percent drop in the stock that followed. After all, expanding existing services into revenue producing models is a relatively cheap way of finding out if previously free offerings can actually add to the bottom line and won’t have any noticeable impact on overall profitability for a while. Still, this was an Apple event and traders a have become accustomed to those producing exciting, ground-breaking innovations. When none of those came, they hit the sell button.  Analysts, on the other hand, generally saw this as what it is: a low-cost exploration of potential new revenue streams. Not that you would know that from some of the headlines. CNBC’s article on the reaction was headlined Wall Street calls Apple event a dud: 'Expect the focus to return to the slowing iPhone business'. That includes a quote from one analyst but read further down and you see that the reactions overall were that the event was anything but “a dud.” The quote was from the analyst at Goldman, whose take was indeed somewhat negative, but the other responses quoted fell into two camps. There were those, like Morgan Stanley and Piper Jaffrey, who raised the stock’s target price, and others, like Bank of America, who basically said that without pricing information it was impossible to assess the impact. I guess that an honest headline about a mixed but slightly positive reaction just wouldn’t have drawn enough clicks. That shows the dangers of reading only headlines, but the real question is what all this means for investors, and the answer to that can be found in history. Put simply, when a giant, cash-rich tech company attempts to branch out to find new revenue sources, there is always a chance of a long-term positive impact on the stock, but even if the attempt fails, it rarely prompts a big decline. A good example would be Google (GOOG: GOOGL)’s various attempts at social media platforms. Google Buzz lasted a year from 2010 to 2011, Friend Connect four years from 2008-12 and, most recently, Google Plus, launched in 2011 was shut down. None of those could be called a resounding success, but as they have unfolded, Google’s stock has gained around 750%. Of course, you could argue that it would have gone up more without them, but the willingness to branch out has also resulted in the company diversifying into other areas that have proven to be winners. The same could be said for Apple. They are no longer just a hardware company. A significant portion of their revenue now comes from various services businesses and that looks set to continue growing, regardless of how these particular services do. Selling AAPL on this latest announcement makes sense for those who had bought it in the belief that the event would be something it wasn’t. For the rest of us though, selling now means betting against the long-term prospects of one of the most successful companies on the planet. That just doesn’t look like a bet that it would be wise to take.",Martin Tillier,"March 26, 2019, 09:48:51 AM EDT",Why AAPL's Drop on Yesterday's Event Shouldn't Matter to Investors,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

48," By Jeffrey Dastin and Ross Kerber April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators shot down attempts by Amazon.com Inc  to stop its investors from considering two shareholder proposals about the company's controversial sale of a facial recognition service, a sign of growing scrutiny of the technology. Decisions including one on Wednesday by officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed an unusual appeal by Amazon to block the non-binding proposals from being voted on at the company's upcoming annual meeting. Both proposals face uphill battles to receive a majority of support from investors in the world's largest online retailer and cloud computing company. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos will retain voting rights over about 16 percent of shares after he and MacKenzie Bezos divorce, she said on Thursday. Amazon declined to comment on the SEC decisions. The company is one of many marketers of facial recognition technology and has disclosed sales to law enforcement and to private customers using the service for purposes such as identifying celebrities. Civil liberties groups have raised concerns including findings by researchers that Amazon's technology struggles more than some peers' to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin, prompting fears of unjust arrests. Amazon has defended its work and said all users must follow the law. Michael Connor, executive director of Open MIC, an advocacy group working with shareholders, including a religious order, who brought the resolutions, said the SEC decisions show the developing rules around facial recognition are ""really a critical issue for a company like Amazon and how it handles the business risk associated with the technology."" According to correspondence posted on the SEC website, Amazon had sought the regulator's permission to skip the proposals as being insignificant to its business, among other things, but was turned down on March 28. Amazon then took the unusual step of asking for a reconsideration of that decision, but was again rebuffed in a April 3 letter from the agency.",,"April 05, 2019, 06:00:00 AM EDT",U.S. blocks Amazon efforts to stop shareholder votes on facial recognition,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,-1,0
49," By Ann Saphir April 4 (Reuters) - Former pizza chain executive Herman Cain, U.S. President Donald Trump's pick for a position on the Federal Reserve's interest-rate setting panel, runs a political fundraising group that has spent more than half its money supporting Trump's reelection. Cain, himself a former Republican presidential candidate and a long-time conservative activist, chairs America Fighting Back PAC, a political action committee created ""by a group of President Trump's most committed supporters,"" according to the group's website. Its mission is to fight ""disrespectful, dishonest and destructive news"" about Trump and bolster a movement of voters to fight for his reelection in 2020. Trump's plan to nominate an overt loyalist for a spot on the Fed board comes as Trump over and over again lambastes the central bank for raising interest rates four times last year and could checker the Fed's long-cherished standing as an independent, apolitical body. Moore is also a longtime Trump ally who has joined him in criticizing last year's rate hikes. Cain was a Republican candidate for president in 2012 before dropping out amid allegations by several women of sexual harassment, which he has vehemently denied. His America Fighting Back PAC has raised $347,000 during the current election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. At least $190,500 of that has gone to Canton, Ohio-based RRTV Media for television advertising in support of Trump, filings with the Federal Election Commission show. The total includes $10,000 just weeks before Cain met with Trump to discuss the Fed job on Jan. 30, and another $9,000 in early March. Cain appears to be the only one of Trump's Fed nominees so far to have actively raised funds for his benefit. He has not individually made any contributions to Trump's campaign. The White House declined comment. A campaign solicitation email signed by Cain was circulated on Feb. 5, less than a week after his interview with Trump. Reuters received a copy of the email directly. ""Friend, I couldn't stand to see our President and his family abused and attacked by the mainstream media and Washington swamp any longer,"" the email began. ""With the 2020 election on the horizon, please become a Founding Member with America Fighting Back PAC by making a contribution of $25, $50, $100, $500, or even $1000 to help us take on all the D.C. forces out to get President Trump,"" the email said. Floyd Brown, a conservative activist who co-chairs the PAC with Cain, said in an email that when Cain learned about Trump's interest in appointing him to the Fed, he voluntarily ""stepped away from day to day involvement with the PAC... (and) has let us know he will resign if nominated."" Brown said the Feb. 5 fundraising email was likely approved before Cain's meeting with Trump, after which ""he immediately ceased his efforts."" The PAC's TV ads were also changed to remove Cain from them, Brown said. Cain, whose Twitter feed continues to be chock full of partisan support for Trump and opposition to his Democratic rivals, did not respond to requests for comment.  POLICYMAKERS AND POLITICAL DONATIONS Fed officials assiduously guard their political independence, seen as crucial for its ability to steer the economy. Close ties with politicians have led central banks in other countries to keep monetary policy too loose, eventually stoking inflation. Trump has stridently criticized the Fed's interest rate hikes, saying they have hurt the economy. Cain's political fundraising could ignite criticism from legislators. The central bank's Washington-based board is picked by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The members of the Board of Governors and the president of the New York Fed are permanent voters on the U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee, while four of the remaining 11 presidents of the regional Fed banks serve on a rotating basis. In 2016 Fed Governor Lael Brainard drew fire from Republican lawmakers for donations to Democrat Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated to win the White House. Brainard's contributions eventually totaled $2,700, the maximum allowed under law. Donations to political candidates by sitting Fed governors are extremely rare, though they are generally allowed under rules which govern the political activities of top Fed officials and other federal employees. Soliciting political contributions is prohibited under those same rules. Four current Fed board members were appointed by Trump, including Chairman Jerome Powell, an appointment Trump apparently regrets. Trump's three other appointees are Randal Quarles, Richard Clarida and Michelle Bowman. Quarles has donated frequently to Republican candidates over the years. His most recent donation, according to the Federal Election Commission, was $35,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in November 2016. That was about seven months before he was picked by Trump for the Fed. Powell, who first became a Fed governor in 2016 as an appointee of President Barack Obama, has not made a federal political donation since 2008, when he gave $28,500 to the Republican National Committee. Bowman's most recent political donation was $500 to Republican Mitt Romney for his presidential run in 2012, FEC records show. Clarida gave $2,000 to George W. Bush in 2004 and has made no political donations since. ",,"April 05, 2019, 06:00:00 AM EDT","As Trump eyed Cain for Fed, Cain raised money for Trump",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
50,"Tim Cook at Apple's keynote event Apple’s (AAPL) transition into a fully-fledged services company took a major leap Monday when the company announced a slew of new services offerings at its Cupertino campus. ""Today's going to be a very different kind of event,"" CEO Tim Cook said at the outset. The company, which brought major star power to Monday’s event, including Oprah Winfrey and directors Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams, has been transitioning more towards its service capabilities as a means to offset slower iPhone sales. Apple didn’t disappoint, unveiling of the company's premium streaming video service called Apple TV+, which many observers perceive as an attack on Netflix (NFLX). The company also announced a new Apple TV app feature called Channels, which allows users an easy way to subscribe to third-party services like HBO and Showtime. The company said the new feature will be made available on Apple devices and soon on smart TVs from Samsung, LG, among others. The app also will be available on Roku (ROKU) and Amazon (AMZN) Fire TV devices. Prior to the event, I took a stab at what the tech giant was likely to reveal. I got two things right. In addition to the premium video service, which Apple said would be available in 100+ countries in the fall, Apple also unveiled a subscription news service called Apple News Plus, which curates news for each user in a section called ""news for you.” The service will cost $9.99 per month. ""This is going to take Apple News to a whole new level,"" Cook said of News Plus. The news platform, which is currently accessible as an app on Apple devices, will be revamped to included some 300 magazine publishers, including Sports Illustrated, National Geographic, Fortune and the New Yorker. The service will feature prominent newspapers such as the L.A. Times and the Wall Street Journal. Much of this was anticipated and highly discussed prior to the event. What was a surprise to investors and analysts, however, was the company’s unveiling of a gaming platform as well as its own credit card. The Apple card, which will be issued by Goldman Sachs (GS), is designed specifically for iPhone users and is tied to Apple Pay and the Apple Wallet. Like most credit card companies, Apple is also offering perks. One of which is called Daily Cash, which it will credit to users daily. This includes rebates for purchases such as 3% for items purchased from Apple, 2% for items purchased using Apple Pay and 1% for every other purchase. What’s more, as with the company’s stance on privacy, Apple says it will not use customer data such as tracking what the customer buys, where they spend their money, and how much they pay. The company says Goldman Sachs will also be restricted from tracking customer data. Although the card is tied to each iPhone, customers can also request a physical card, which Apple says will contain no card number, CVV, expiration date, or signature. The physical card, which will be available starting in the summer, will be made of titanium and will contain the customer’s name, which will be laser-etched. Finally, Apple took a bite out of the $140 billion gaming industry by introducing Apple Arcade — a subscription gaming service that will feature 100 new games exclusive solely to Apple. The gaming services will be available as an app in the app store, allows users to start a game on one Apple device and continue it on another. Without announcing a pricing plan, the company says Arcade will be available in the fall of 2019. The overall grade of everything Apple announced Monday will take more time to assess. But it is clear that the company’s focus on its services business has reached another level.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 26, 2019, 08:06:20 AM EDT",Did Apple (AAPL) Just Re-Invent Itself As a Services Company?,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
51," By Tom Westbrook SYDNEY, April 5 (Reuters) - Social media giant Facebook Inc  said on Friday it would strengthen measures to fight fake news in Australia and briefly block foreigners from buying political advertisements in the lead-up to a national election due in a few weeks. The move comes with the company - and its peers around the world - under growing pressure to rid their platforms of misinformation after Russia allegedly used Facebook to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook's move also comes as its market power and social influence faces greater scrutiny, particularly in the wake of the mass shooting at a mosque in New Zealand which was broadcast live on one of the U.S. firm's platforms. Facebook said its new controls on Australian political advertising would take effect as soon as the vote was called, which is expected to happen in the next few days. Foreigners would be forbidden from buying advertising mentioning political parties, slogans and logos, Mia Garlick, Facebook's director of policy for Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement. To fight so-called fake news and misinformation, the U.S. firm would launch a fact-checking service in Australia in partnership with French news agency Agence France-Presse, she added. It would also remove fake accounts and make sensational stories less prominent in users' newsfeeds. Australia's major political parties, which between them are expected to spend millions of dollars buying Facebook ads during the campaign, had no comment on the company's announcement on Friday.  GLOBAL PROBLEM Policing social media content has become a massive global problem, with no template for consistently preventing fake news online or eliminating it. Andrea Carson, a political scientist specialising in media and communications at La Trobe University in Melbourne, said Facebook faced tighter regulation in the future. ""There's a climate for change,"" she said. Fierce internet disinformation battles have gripped countries such as Brazil and Malaysia ahead of elections. Authorities in Indonesia and the European Union, which are due to hold polls, have also warned of the threat of fake news, while in India, Facebook has ramped up efforts to block fake accounts.",,"April 05, 2019, 01:06:00 AM EDT",Facebook promises crackdown on fake news in Australia,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Things will get even tougher this year, with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) expected to release a lower cost, disc-free Xbox One and Alphabet  (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) launching its Stadia streaming game service that can deliver AAA games to mobile devices. In response to these challenges, the company is reportedly working on two new Nintendo Switch models: a low-cost version and a higher-end model. With Nintendo stock down 36% from this time last year, and the Switch now two years old, the company clearly feels it needs to make some big moves in 2019. Going back to last fall, slowing Switch momentum was hitting Nintendo stock as investors got nervous. Even after delivering its best Q2 in eight years , NTDOY took a hit over concerns that the Switch wasn't going to sell in the numbers Nintendo was aiming for. Then the first rumors that a new Nintendo Switch was in the works began in the fall of 2018. The Wall Street Journal reported that Nintendo had plans for a new model of its handheld hybrid console planned for release this summer, with the LCD display expected to get an update. After that initial speculation, rumors began to grow that there was indeed a new Nintendo Switch coming in 2019, but that it would be a lower cost, "" stripped-down "" version of the current console. Today, The Wall Street Journa l came out with a new report on NTDOY's hardware plans . This time, the newspaper's sources say both rumors are true: Nintendo is actually working on two new Switch consoles, a low-cost version, and a new higher-end model. The strategy of releasing a pair of new Nintendo Switch models could solve multiple problems Nintendo faces in 2019. The low-cost version, which is reported to ditch a few features like the controller's rumble capability, with a focus on portability, could be the successor to the 3DS. Nintendo's lower cost portable is now eight years old, and its sales are declining more quickly than the company anticipated. A low-cost Switch (which would still be compatible with all Switch games) would take over from the 3DS and appeal to gamers who couldn't afford the current Switch. This budget-friendly version could also convince owners of other consoles to pick up a cheap Switch as well, for portable gaming.  The increase in overall Switch units would also help to keep third-party game developers interested in the platform. A higher-end version of the Switch would include an improved LCD display and a new processor. According to the WSJ report, Nintendo is targeting gamers who lean toward the Xbox One X or PS4 Pro (although the new Nintendo Switch would not be as powerful as those consoles). It is also likely to trigger an upgrade cycle among current Switch owners who want the improved hardware. The company is expected to follow the same approach Microsoft and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) took with their upgraded consoles, ensuring games are playable on all console versions, but offering enhanced graphics performance on the higher-end model. Last year, Nintendo tried keeping the Switch's momentum going with Labo cardboard building kits and the release of several big games, primarily Super Smash Bros . While that led to some record-setting quarters, including a holiday sales quarter where the company moved 9.4 million units (up 30% from the previous year), NTDOY still had to revise its full-year sales of the console down. After two years on the market, offering two new Nintendo Switch models - one for price-conscious shoppers and one to tempt hardcore gamers - may be the answer to kickstarting sales. And the move may just help Nintendo stock recover from the past year's losses. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

58," By Mircely Guanipa and Deisy Buitrago PUNTO FIJO/CARACAS, April 4 (Reuters) - Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA expects its crucial crude upgraders to operate well below capacity this month, according to industry sources and documents seen by Reuters, as U.S. sanctions and energy blackouts hit the OPEC nation's oil industry. Venezuela depends on the upgraders, which are mostly operated by joint ventures with foreign companies, to convert the extra-heavy crude oil produced in the Orinoco Belt into exportable grades usable in overseas refineries. Together, they have a capacity of some 700,000 barrels per day. The Petropiar and Petromonagas upgraders, part-owned by U.S. oil major Chevron  and Russian giant Rosneft  respectively, have not fully restarted since a March 7 blackout. Petrocedeno, part-owned by France's Total  and Norway'sEquinor, stopped working after a second blackout on March 25, as did PDVSA's fully-owned Petrosanfelix. ""The upgraders are still halted,"" oil workers' union leader Jose Bodas said. According to an internal PDVSA document seen by Reuters this week, Petropiar and Petrocedeno are ""in the process of restarting."" Petromonagas is expected to undergo ""cleaning and repair"" this month after maintenance workers found two of its furnaces were obstructed by waste products, while a maintenance process at Petrosanfelix was halted, according to the document. ""The upgraders are not expected to increase processing,"" an internal PDVSA document detailing planning for the month of April reads. It said Petrosanfelix was unlikely to restart, while the remaining three would likely process crude at reduced rates. One industry source, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to speak publicly, said the blockages of Petromonagas' furnaces was likely to keep the upgrader out of commission for 20 days. The source said the company had canceled all its shipments of upgraded crude for April. Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela's oil ministry responded to a request for comment. Total declined to comment, while Chevron referred questions to Petropiar, which like all oil joint ventures in Venezuela is controlled by PDVSA. Rosneft and Equinor did not respond to requests for comment.  EXPORTS TUMBLED IN FEBRUARY The blackouts have presented an additional obstacle for President Nicolas Maduro's efforts to halt a years-long drop in oil output, Venezuela's main source of government revenue. The decline in production is expected to accelerate after the United States sanctioned PDVSA in late January, as part of its bid to oust Maduro from power. Exports fell about 40 percent in February in the immediate aftermath of the sanctions, but remained stable in March at slightly below 1 million barrels per day (bpd). To keep exports stable with limited upgrading capacity, PDVSA will need to import diluents - light crude or heavy naphtha - that can be blended directly with extra heavy oil from the Orinoco belt to make exportable grades. But the sanctions blocked U.S. companies, previously the main suppliers of diluents to Venezuela, from selling the products to PDVSA. The Petrosinovensa blending facility, a joint venture of PDVSA and China's CNPC that produces Merey crude, was producing about 60 percent of the 132,000 bpd of upgraded crude it planned to produce, the PDVSA document showed. To avoid a further drop in exports, the country has recently turned to Rosneft for supply of diluents, according to the industry source and Refinitiv Eikon data.",,"April 04, 2019, 06:50:00 PM EDT",Venezuela's PDVSA braces for low output from crucial crude upgraders,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

62," By Jeff Mason and David Lawder WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States and China were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks, while warning Beijing that it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without a pact. The two countries are engaged in intense negotiations to end a months-long trade war that has rattled global markets, but hopes of a resolution soared after both sides expressed optimism following talks in Beijing last week. ""We're getting very close to making a deal. That doesn't mean a deal is made, because it's not, but we're certainly getting a lot closer,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""And I would think with, oh, within the next four weeks or maybe less, maybe more, whatever it takes, something very monumental could be announced."" Trump said he would hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping if there were a deal. Xi assured Trump that text of the China-U.S. trade could be finalised soon, in a message conveyed by Liu He. According to state-run news agency Xinhua, Liu He told Trump that Xi believed under his and Trump's leadership, China-U.S. relations will make new and greater progress. Xi said that in the past month or more, the two sides' trade teams had maintained close contact and ""achieved new and substantive progress on issues in the text of two countries' trade agreement"". ""I hope the two sides' trade teams can continue working in the spirit of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit to resolve each other's concerns, and finish negotiations on the text of the China-U.S. trade agreement soon,"" Xi said to Trump through Liu.  KEEPING LEVERAGE Trump declined to say what would happen to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods as part of a deal. China wants the tariffs lifted, while U.S. officials are wary of giving up that leverage, at least for now. Asked about the benefits of an agreement for China, Trump said: ""It's going to be great for China, in that China will continue to trade with the United States. I mean, otherwise, it would be very tough for us to allow that to happen."" Goods trade between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, totaled $660 billion last year, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, consisting of imports of $540 billion from China and $120 billion in exports to China. On China's behalf, Liu cited ""great progress"" in the talks because of Trump's direct involvement and expressed hope that the talks would lead to ""a good result.""  U.S. SEEKS SWEEPING CHANGES Trump has previously threatened to impose punitive tariffs on all imports from China, more than a half-trillion dollars worth of products. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who is leading the talks for the Trump administration, said there were still some ""major, major issues"" to resolve and praised Liu's commitment to reform in China. Asked about the remaining sticking points, Trump mentioned tariffs and intellectual property theft. He said he would discuss tariffs with Liu in their meeting. ""Some of the toughest things have been agreed to,"" Trump said. He later said that an enforcement plan for a deal remained a sticking point as well. ""We have to make sure there's enforcement. I think we'll get that done. We've discussed it at length,"" he said. Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are holding talks in Washington with a Chinese delegation this week after meeting together in Beijing last week. The current round of talks is scheduled to go through Friday and possibly longer. Hopes that the talks were moving in a positive direction have cheered financial markets in recent weeks. But U.S. stocks were mixed on Thursday as investors waited for more developments in the trade negotiations, with the Dow Jones industrial Average  slightly higher, and the S&P 500  and Nasdaq Composite  slightly lower. The United States is seeking reforms to Chinese practices that it says result in the theft of U.S. intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology from U.S. companies to Chinese firms. Administration officials initially envisioned a summit between Trump and Xi potentially taking place in March, but some U.S. lawmakers and lobbying groups have said recently they were told that the administration was now aiming for a deal in late April.  OUTSTANDING ISSUES White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last week that the talks were ""not time dependent"" and could be extended for weeks or even months longer. While some reform pledges by Beijing are largely set, including an agreement to avoid currency manipulation, an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China keeps its pledges and the status of U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods must be resolved. ""China has been very clear, publicly and privately, that they would like to see all the tariffs removed,"" U.S. Chamber of Commerce international affairs chief Myron Brilliant told reporters on Tuesday.",,"April 04, 2019, 06:19:00 PM EDT",Trump says U.S-China trade deal could be announced in about four weeks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
63," By Aaron Saldanha April 4 (Reuters) - Most Latin American stock markets and currencies rose on Thursday, with assets in Brazil gaining on hopes of smooth progress on pension reform, while their Mexican peers firmed on broadly positive political developments with the United States. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro met fellow politicians in a bid to build support to pass his government's proposal to reform the country's bloated pension system, seen by investors as crucial to trim Brazil's wide fiscal deficit. Sao Paulo-traded stocks  tacked on 1.9 percent, clocking broad-based gains in their best one-day performance in two weeks. The index more than made up ground lost in Wednesday's 0.9 percent slide. Rafael Bevilacqua, chief strategist at investment consultancy Levante, said the performance was a combination of a recovery from the previous session's losses and optimism around the government's attempt to articulate its reform proposal. Common shares  and preferred shares  of state-run oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) jumped 3.3 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively. Brazil's mines and energy minister said he is optimistic there will be a deal by next week resolving the government's dispute with Petrobras over the offshore oil-producing zone known as the transfer of rights area. Petrobras is expected to receive a multibillion-dollar payment from the government to resolve a dispute over a 2010 deal granting the firm rights to extract oil in the area. Shares of miner Vale SA  rose 0.7 percent, following part of a rise seen in Dalian-traded iron ore futures  earlier in the global day. Brazil's real  strengthened 0.4 percent, while yields on its local, 10-year bonds  dipped to 8.93 percent. Mexican stocks  rose 1.4 percent while the peso  firmed 0.4 percent. U.S. President Donald Trump said a ""lot of good things are happening in Mexico."" Trump, however, threatened to apply tariffs at 25 percent on car imports from Mexico unless the country did more to stop drug trafficking. Chilean stocks  gained 1.2 percent, matching the rise on Argentina's stocks benchmark, which partly recovered from Wednesday's 3.8 percent drubbing. Argentina's peso  slid. Industrial output in February slid 8.5 percent, data showed, marking the tenth straight month of declines. Colombia's stocks  were the exception to regional optimism on the day, dipping 0.1 percent, while the local peso  weakened 0.2 percent.

65,"Shutterstock photo There has been tons of speculation as to what Apple (AAPL) may announce at its event — dubbed ""It's showtime” — which will be held on March 25 at the Steve Jobs Theater on its Apple Park campus. Chief among the rumored unveiling is the likelihood that the tech giant will unveil a new services offering, which is widely expected to include a video subscription service and a news subscription. The latter has been touted by analysts as the Netflix (NFLX) for news service. Reports suggest that publishers needed tons of persuading from Apple to agree to a revenue share model, where Apple plans to keep about 50% of subscription revenue, according to WSJ sources. Needless to say, this is an important event, particularly for investors and analysts who have been obsessed about the need for Apple to diversify its business away from iPhones. Apple shares closed Friday at $191.05. The shares, which received three analyst upgrades on Thursday, are up 21% year to date and have risen 27% over the past three months, besting the 10% year-to-date rise in the S&P; 500 index. One of the upgrades on Thursday came from Laura Martin, analyst at Needham, who assigned the stock with a Strong Buy rating. ""On Monday, Apple will announce a new content service that, IF adopted by its users, should lower churn and drive higher lifetime value for each of Apple's 900 million unique ecosystem users,” Martin said. Adding, “Additionally, it might attract new users to Apple's ecosystem.” Aside from the widely-expected new services bundle, Apple is also rumored to debut a stand-alone video streaming service as well, according to the Information, which earlier this year noted that Apple was in negotiations with studios and networks, advising them to be prepared for an April launch. Bloomberg reported last week that Apple had reached out to AT&T; (T), parent company of HBO as well as CBS Corp (CBS), which owns Showtime, in its rush to assemble a catalog of film and television for said subscription service. It is not known how far these conversations (or negotiations) have gotten. And there are no clear details as to whether Apple would bundle the news service along with the streaming service, or if they will be offered separately. What we do know is the company has long had ambitions to enter this space and has signed a number of production or development agreements with both producers and Hollywood actors. This is in addition to the company last year announcing a multi-year partnership with Oprah Winfrey. It remains to be seen whether any of these rumors are correct. What is clear is that, based on both confirmed and unconfirmed reports, Apple’s streaming service catalog will contain a mix of content that is either funded by Apple as well as those owned by major studios which it will license. As for the news subscription service unveiling, which is said to be priced at monthly rate of $10, this one is not so clear cut. Reports suggests Apple would aggregate news and magazine subscriptions into one product. I’m curious to know what else will the subscription provide, given that some publishers such as The Washington Post and New York Times are hesitant to sign up due to the terms of the proposed revenue share agreement. All that said, the good news is that the company is looking to diversify its business, which bodes well for its long-term prospects.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 25, 2019, 08:04:33 AM EDT",Apple's (AAPL) March 25 Event: What to Expect,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
66," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) had more than 540 million records regarding its users that were publicly exposed, according to a cybersecurity research firm.  UpGuard announced on Wednesday that this data was exposed on Amazon's cloud computing service, as two third-party Facebook app developers posted these records for all to see. This marks the second such data breach for the social media site as the company faced a similar fate last year. The firm said that a Mexico-based media company called Cultura Colectiva was to blame for the leak, exposing roughly 146 gigabytes of Facebook user data. This included account names, IDs, as well as details about comments and reactions to posts, although it's unclear the number of individual users that had their data exposed. There was also an app called At the Pool that exposed databases that included data regarding Facebook user IDs, friends, photos, as well as location check ins. The app also found unprotected Facebook passwords for 22,000 users. The app was designed to help people meet up for offline activities and it shut down in 2014. UpGuard said it told Cultura Colectiva and Amazon about the breaches back in January, but no action was taken until yesterday morning. An Amazon ""storage bucket"" containing the data from Cultura Colectiva was reportedly secured, according to Facebook. The data from At the Pool made its way offline before UpGuard reached the business about it. FB stock is up 1.3% Thursday.

""Stranded with Sam and Colby"" (Bunim/Murray Productions) -     A pair of influencers film from a haunted location and what     starts as something fun quickly takes a terrifying turn.     Docuseries launches Fall 2019. ""Dead of Night"" (Bazelevs in association with Hooked) -     Armed with only her phone, a teenage girl must escape a     quarantined city full of zombies. Shot in ScreenLife,     exclusively from the point of view of the smartphone screen.     Based on a Hooked story. Produced by Bazelevs in association     with Hooked. Scripted series launches October 2019.   Related stories  Snapchat Launches Its Games Platform,       Starting With Six Titles   With Syndicated Stories and an Ad Network,       Snapchat Cautiously Opens Up Snapchat    maker Snap is getting ready to unleash 10 new shows on its   audience: The company used its first-ever Snap Partner Summit in   Los Angeles Thursday to announce new original content, ranging   from unscripted daily entertainment news to scripted shows   starring zombies, sneaker culture and teenage angst. ""Mobile is now the dominant medium for telling stories and   consuming content,"" said   Snapchat    original content head Sean Mills at the summit Thursday. ""In   2019, mobile will surpass television in time spent for U.S.   adults. This transformation is creating massive new   opportunities."" Snap wants to make use of those opportunities with shows that   are mobile-only, and take cues from the way Snapchat's users   already interact with each other on the platform. One example for   this is ""Two Sides,"" a new teenage drama from New Form that is   slated to launch in May. In the show, a teenage couple navigates   a modern-day breakup, complete with misunderstood messages, in a   split-screen view that shows us the two sides of falling out of   love. The company is also relying on some of the insights it gains   from usage patterns on its platform to figure out what kind of   content is going to work with its audience. The best example for   that is ""Sneakerheads,"" a scripted comedy series from Indigo   Development and Entertainment Arts and EMJAG Productions that is   slated to launch in June. The show is not just about sneaker culture, it was also   directly informed by the popularity of the topic on Snapchat,   with a Snap spokesperson crediting a story about a sneaker   convention that attracted an outsized amount of attention as a   key reason why the company commissioned the show. Snap continues to monetize these originals via its 6-second   unskippable ads. Some original shows are partner-funded, while   others are funded by the company itself; 2 of the shows announced   Thursday were produced by Indigo Development, the joint venture   Snap and NBCUniversal formed last year, while others come from   BuzzFeed, New Form, Bazelevs and others.

Apple    has kept a tight lid on most of the details of its upcoming   service, even keeping its creative partners in the dark about how   exactly their work will be distributed. What is undisputed,   however, is that the tech giant with a nearly $1 trillion market   cap has lined up a who's who of high-profile talent to vault it   into the increasingly crowded original-content arena. Apple is set to unveil its plans for a launching of a revved   up Apple TV offering aggregating channels and apps, its plan for   original content and a subscription news service on Monday   at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif.makeArticleAd(); The company's active roster is focused on well-known IP and   packages with big names in front of and behind the camera. The   company has been widely reported to have budgeted $1 billion to   launch its most ambitious TV effort to date. Among the high-profile shows ordered to series at Apple   are:  a Reese Witherspoon-Jennifer Aniston morning show     drama; an Emily Dickinson half-hour series starring Hailee     Steinfeld; dramas ""Little Voices"" and ""My Glory Was I Had Such     Friends"" from executive producer J.J. Abrams, with the latter     to star Jennifer Garner; drama ""Are You Sleeping"" starring Octavia Spencer; an adaptation of the book ""Defending Jacob"" starring and     executive produced by Chris Evans; a based-on-a-true story CIA     drama starring ""Captain Marvel's"" Brie Larson; and a video-game development studio comedy from ""It's     Always Sunny in Philadelphia's"" Rob McElhenney and Charlie     Day.  And that's just for starters. Nearly two years after Apple   recruited former Sony TV presidents Zack Van Amburg and Jamie   Erlicht, not a single frame of footage from any of Apple's shows   has been publicly released. One aspect of Apple's subscription   television product that has been confirmed is that the company   will not only distribute its own shows but also seeks to be a   gateway to selling third-party video subscription services like   Starz and Showtime, for a healthy fee. It remains to be seen if   AT&T's HBO will be an Apple partner. Netflix disclosed last   week that it will not be on the platform. This part of Apple's video push is expected to closely mimic   Amazon's Channels business. The e-commerce giant has found   success in subscription video with the help of established   customer relationships: Amazon already has billing information   for its customers on file, and is streaming HBO and Showtime   through the same apps that consumers already use to access   Amazon's own content. Finally, Amazon has made it dead-simple to   subscribe to new channels directly from its Fire TV devices, with   nothing more than your TV remote. All of that has helped the company to turn Channels into the   biggest marketplace for standalone video subscription services   since its launch in late 2015, with The Diffusion Group   estimating a year ago that Amazon was singlehandedly responsible   for   55% of all standalone video subscriptions    . However, executives of some video services have complained of   a power imbalance in their dealings with Amazon, with the   e-commerce giant handling all of their customer relations. Some   services may be wary that Apple will become another powerful   middle-man. But with the exception of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings,   few have said outright that   they won't be part of Apple's service    . Overall, analysts are widely optimistic ahead of Monday's   announcement. Needham & Company's Laura Martin upgraded Apple   from a ""buy"" to a ""strong buy"" recommendation this week, arguing   that the launch of the video service could help the company to   both extract more value from each customer, and also dramatically   reduce churn. ""Our calculations imply that services double the   lifetime value per user,"" Martin wrote in a note to   investors. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives was equally optimistic,   writing in a note to investors: ""We believe Monday's announcement   is just the tip of the iceberg for Cook's broader streaming   content strategy to take hold and in our opinion adds a   significant potential catalyst to the Apple services growth story   for years to come.""

76,"Snap CEO Evan Spiegel wants to have it both ways: Keep      Snapchat    insulated from the darker sides of the internet, and also open it   up to some of the rest of the web. Spiegel shared these dueling visions during the company's   first partner summit in Los Angeles Thursday. In a keynote   speech, the chief executive not only introduced new products, but   also aimed to separate Snap from some of the companies that have   been under scrutiny in recent months. Without naming competitor Facebook specifically, Spiegel   seemed to suggest that   Snapchat    could be an antidote to many of the negative aspects of social   networking. ""Our camera lets the natural light from our world   penetrate the darkness of the internet,"" he said. ""The internet   started as a military research project. It's just not our natural   habitat. But as we use the internet more and more in our daily   lives, we need a way to make it a bit more human.""makeArticleAd(); That notion is not new: Snapchat, with its ephemeral nature,   and the absence of a newsfeed with like and share counts, has   been immune to some of the privacy pitfalls and disinformation   campaigns that Facebook has struggled with, executives have   argued. At the same time, Snap introduced a number of new features   meant to interconnect with other apps and services Thursday that   ultimately make the company and its products a lot more like   Facebook. The most important such initiative is the Snap Audience   Network, an ad network that promises to bring ads running on   Snapchat to third-party apps, giving app publishers a new revenue   stream and Snap the ability to sell bigger audiences to   advertisers. The company said it would begin signing up app   developers immediately, with plans to launch the actual ad   network on iOS apps in the U.S. in the future. Another example: As part of a new web integration, Snap is   launching the kind of sharing buttons you already know from   Twitter and Facebook. The Washington Post will be a launch   partner for this feature, which will make it easier for users to   share article links back to Snapchat. (The company also announced   a range of different app and service integrations with a number   of other companies, ranging from GoFundMe to Netflix.) But as Snap rolls out those partnerships, it also shares some   of its user data with those partners - a practice that has   attracted criticism even in some more benign cases in recent   months, with the biggest headlines reserved for data leaks   affecting many millions of customers. How hard it will be to square the notion of the knight in   shining armor with the realities of inter-connected commercial   services was evident during a background briefing the company   conducted for select journalists ahead of the summit earlier this   week. Peppered with questions about privacy implications of some   of Snapchat's new initiatives, company spokespeople scrambled to   assure journalists that Snap had a different approach to privacy,   and that it would stick to those values even while opening   up. Getting that balance right could be crucial for Snap. Facebook   has faced an avalanche of criticism over the ways it has been   sharing data with partners, and used its third-party integrations   to grow its own data coffers. Snap wants to avoid some of those pitfalls by limiting the   types of data it shares with partners. Spokespeople said   third-party apps won't have access to friend graph data - an   industry term for data points about the friends a user has on   social networks, and data those friends are sharing with that   user. Snap has been less specific about other types of data it could   collect as it allows developers to add its own code to their apps   and sites. One example: Facebook has faced scrutiny over   so-called shadow profiles - data it collects on internet users   that may not even have Facebook accounts of their own, but use   websites that implement Facebook tracking codes, either through   Facebook's advertising network, or simply by adding a Facebook   share button to their site. Snap spokespeople suggested that the company would only   collect aggregate data from third-party sources, but also   acknowledged that some of the details of its ad network still had   to be ironed out. The company will also have to tackle other issues as it   gradually opens up. One of them is what some have called Stories   fatigue. Snapchat may have pioneered Stories as a format, but the   rest of the internet didn't shy away from copying it. Led by   Facebook's embrace of the rival's core feature, Stories have   found their way pretty much everywhere. Now, Snapchat may further that overload by allowing its own   users to share Stories in select third-party apps. Company   executives said Thursday that Snap had partnered with dating   service Tinder, video chat app Houseparty, and outdoor activities   app Adventure Aide to bring custom Snapchat Stories to their   apps. These types of integrations are supposed to launch at some   point in 2019. In a way, these so-called App Stories can even be seen as a   defensive move. If every app gets its own version of Stories,   then why not power those Stories to make sure that these apps   don't replace Snapchat in the process? Snapchat executives also announced new features that play to   the company's strengths. One of them is its AR integration, which   has thus far primarily focused on lenses for selfies, animal   pics, and more. Users and developers have created more than   400,000 such lenses, which have been used over 15 billion times,   according to company information. On Thursday, Snapchat started rolling out another version of   lenses called Landmarkers. These are geolocated AR effects   associated with historic landmarks. At launch, only five of these   locations will be made available, including the Buckingham Palace   in London, the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., the Eiffel   Tower in Paris, the Flatiron Building in New York, and the   Chinese Theater in Los Angeles (   see  the image above for an example    ). The way Snap has been developing these AR filters shows that   the company's users are an asset in more ways than one.   Spokespeople said Snap used photos from Stories feeds to recreate   what's known as a point cloud, which is essentially a way to   recreate a 3D image of an object based on a number of individual   data points. Snapchat is also making use of some of its public user data to   inform decisions around its original content efforts for Snapchat   Discover.   A show about sneaker culture that Snapchat   announced Thursday    was directly influenced by employees observing a trend of public   stories of a sneaker convention over-performing with the app's   users, according to a company spokesperson. To gain these kinds of insights, Snapchat needs to keep its   audience engaged, and ideally grow it further - something that   has been a challenge in recent quarters. Spiegel seemed to   suggest Thursday that the company's stagnating growth doesn't   tell the whole story, pointing to a reach of nearly 75% of all   13- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. ""We reach 90% of 13- to   24-year-olds,"" he added during his keynote speech. ""In fact, we   reach more 13- to 24-year-olds than Facebook or Instagram in the   United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and   Australia."" ""We believe that by opening into the camera, we can create a   computing experience that combines the superpowers of technology   with the best of humanity,"" Spiegel said Thursday, further   raising the bar for Snapchat's lofty moral ambitions. Whether   Snapchat's users will buy into that idea may at least in part   depend on how the company handles the challenges it faces as it   adapts to a more interconnected world of apps and internet   services.

77," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Largely driven by hopes and dreams for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) upcoming streaming offering, Apple stock has rallied in recent weeks. In fact, so far in 2019, Apple stock is up over 24%.  But these hopes seem to be misplaced. For a variety of reasons, ranging from a  lack of access to many consumers' TVs to a lack of first-mover advantage to a lack of demand for what AAPL reportedly plans to offer, Apple streaming almost definitely won't move the needle for Apple stock. Therefore, I believe that investors should sell Apple stock ahead of the event, which is scheduled for 1 p.m. ET on March 25. Here are the top five reasons (in no particular order) why the streaming product is very unlikely to move the needle for Apple  stock. I've written about the tremendous competition in the sector streaming before in reference to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) stock , but it's  worth repeating here, since AAPL is about to enter the same space. In a column published by InvestorPlace on Feb 8, I wrote: ""The price hike isn't going to help Netflix's battle against its emerging competitors in the streaming space. Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) ESPN+, which recently announced that it has 2 million subscribers, Dish's (NASDAQ: DISH ) Sling TV, which had 2.4 million  subscribers as of November 2018 , Hulu, with  25 million subscribers , YouTubeTV,  Roku  (NASDAQ: ROKU ), and Plex are among the other services competing for streaming TV dollars."" Additionally, later this year, DIS will introduce its own entertainment streaming service, Disney+, and only in the last week , I've discovered a new, free streaming service, Pluto TV , which looks pretty robust. Also, first-mover advantage, i.e. the advantage that the first major product in a category has, is often tremendous.  Think of Netflix in video streaming, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) in e-commerce, and the iPod from Apple. All of the efforts to introduce competition to those initial products did not unseat them. In video streaming, AAPL will not even be the second, third, or even fourth mover. AAPL did make a deal with Samsung to offer the Apple streaming app on all Samsung TVs. Still, it turns out Samsung TVs have a market share of only 33% in the U.S. smart TV market. Meanwhile,  anyone with an Apple device will reportedly get Apple streaming for free , so AAAPL won't get any subscription revenue from its own massive installed base. That presumably includes the owners of Apple TV devices, which had a whopping 15% share of the U.S. market as of the middle of last year. Had AAPL followed my advice and bought Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ) in addition to making the deal with Samsung, it would have had access to many more consumers. It also might have been able to make a tremendous amount of money from selling ads. Roku has estimated that a quarter of all TVs in the U.S. had Roku pre-installed, and Roku apparently does not come pre-installed on Samsung TVs. Plus, in August, 27% of Americans who used a device other than a smart TV to watch stream in television utilized Roku, a survey by research firm William Blair found.  Due to the popularity and high prices of Apple's iPhone, it's not easy to meaningfully improve Apple's financial results with other items. Consequently, it's very difficult for Tim Cook and his staff to move the needle for Apple stock. It looks like even if Apple streaming is wildly successful, it won't meaningfully impact Apple's financial results for some time. Specifically, last month Jefferies analyst Tim O'Shea calculated that, even if 250 million people sign up for the streaming service, ""it still would account for only about 5% of the company's revenue that year - and wouldn't make up for its declining smartphone sales,"" Boy Genius quoted Business Insider as reporting. As a result of Netflix's low prices and the ever-increasing competition, AAPL can't charge high prices for its service.  O'Shea estimated that it would only charge $15 per month for it. If the report about Apple streaming being free for owners of the company's devices is correct, it will really limit the products ability to move the needle for Apple stock. It appears that AAPL hopes that it can make Apple streaming lucrative by using it to sell subscriptions to bundled, paid channels. AAPL will reportedly keep 30% of the revenue from these deals. And, importantly, unlike Amazon, Apple will be able to sell the bundled channels for less than they would cost if consumers had bought them individually. But there are a number of flaws with this plan. Many people already have plenty of content from Netflix and Amazon. Many more have Hulu or Sling. And now Apple is presumably going to offer free content to the owners of Apple devices. First of all, how much content do people need? Secondly, the whole point of cord cutting is to save money. If consumers are paying for Netflix and, say, Hulu, and then add one of Apple bundles and Disney+ for their kids, they're not going to save any money by cutting the cord. For the same amount of money, they could probably have an expensive cable package with TiVo. And that leads me to my next point; many of the people who have enough money to buy Apple's bundles probably already have old-fashioned things called premium cable channels and TiVo. About the only audience that Apple's bundles could have tremendous appeal for are wealthy people living abroad who love American content. But that's a limited audience, and Netflix and Amazon are already filling that niche. Apple is apparently betting that signing big names, such as Oprah and Steve Carell, to make content for Apple streaming will put it heads and shoulders above the competition. But history shows that big names don't always, or even usually, create big hits or even beat the competition. For instance, was Oprah's OWN cable channel a tremendous hit? Can you even name any of Carrell's  projects since he left The Office ? Amazon thought it could guarantee hit films by hiring Woody Allen to write them. That didn't work out too well for Jeff Bezos and crew. And even if the content isn't vastly superior, maybe Apple streaming could beat the tremendous competition in the sector if its product had some huge technical edge. But technical innovation has not been a hallmark of AAPL under Cook. Moreover, a large number of reports about the project have emerged, and none of them seems to discuss technology. Therefore, that scenario seems unlikely to play out. For all of the reasons outlined above, Apple streaming does not seem well-positioned to be the savior of Apple stock. Moreover, Apple's crown jewel, the iPhone, is still in trouble, and AAPL is facing threats on other fronts, such as the possibility that content creators will stop paying the App Store's ""Apple tax."" Therefore, I recommend selling Apple stock now. As of this writing, the author did not own stock in any of the aforementioned companies.

The patent describes a system that would allow the case of the MacBook to expand out to allow for better airflow. This sounds like it could work on paper, but it may not be a feature that goes over well with customers. Either way, it is only a patent and may never actually see use in one of the company's products. HomePod Price : It's now cheaper to buy an Apple HomePod , reports MacRumors . The tech company is no longer charging $349 for its smartspeaker. Instead, customers will now only have to pay $299 for the device.

79," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Amazon broadband internet access is something the company is working on, but don't expect it anytime soon.  A recent report reveals that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is looking to launch 3,236 satellites into low orbit to provide customers with high-speed internet. It also notes that the internet that these satellites will provide should be low on latency. The idea behind the Amazon broadband internet plan is that it will allow the company to reach a large area with its satellites. This includes anyone living from 56 degrees north to 56 degrees south of the equator. That would include more than 90% of people on the planet. ""Project Kuiper is a new initiative to launch a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites that will provide low-latency, high-speed broadband connectivity to unserved and underserved communities around the world,"" an Amazon spokesperson told GeekWire . While Amazon does confirm that it is working on the project, not much else is currently known about it. This includes details about when it will launch the satellites, when the service will launch, or how much customers will have to pay for it. So how exactly is the company planning to get satellites in orbit for the Amazon broadband internet service? Luckily for it, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos can help out. Bezos operates another company called Blue Origin . This is a company that is working on rockets and has plans to send passengers into low orbit as a form of tourism.

81,"Shutterstock photo By Katherine Noall, CEO of Sphere Identity, a global identity blockchain-based platform for identity storage and on-boarding. Identity verification poses a significant challenge to businesses in the E-Commerce industry and beyond. Ensuring customers are who they say they are, otherwise known as Know Your Customer (KYC), is the only way to run an efficient business that limits fraud and complies with anti-money laundering regulations. In the same vein, storing vast amounts of consumer data is not only an ethical grey area depending on how that data is used, but also creates centralized databases, or honeypots, which are attractive targets for hackers. Over the past several years as blockchain technology has begun to seep into mainstream consciousness, much has been done behind the scenes to incorporate its trustless, transparent characteristics to tackle these challenges from both sides, for both businesses and customers. When KYC is required for the customer in the E-Commerce space, it typically involves typing information such as names, contact numbers, and email addresses, in addition to uploading documents, such as driver’s licenses and passports. However, storing vast amounts of consumer data is not only an ethical grey area depending on how that data is used, but the information and documents customers must provide are also generally unencrypted, making them easily interceptable. The information is then centrally stored and a database, or honeypot, is created, leaving an attractive paper trail for hackers and other bad actors. As it stands, the customer journey is designed to improve the user experience for sign-ups, breaking down the process into a series of pages. This might make it look less daunting on the surface, but instead causes increased onboarding fatigue for customers who have to endure page after page of form filling. Research has shown that 22% of online abandonment is caused by customers balking at online forms, and this trend further adds to this figure. E-commerce businesses that continue to use online forms — whether on one page or segregated across many, are leaving revenue and opportunities on the table. Enter blockchain technology. The use of blockchain for KYC positively impacts time, money and other resources required for on-boarding. Applying blockchain technology causes KYC automation to be highly scalable and more secure. Scalable, because it is inherently global; secure, because the technology is tamper-resistant and has inbuilt security, including encryption and time stamping. This makes the distributed, encrypted storage of identity documents and data possible, and with this, identity honeypots will reduce as the industry matures. In time, these honeypots with be replaced with improved mechanisms for self-sovereign identity. The beauty of self-sovereign identity is that it is distributed, and puts the user in control of the information that makes up their identity, who the information is shared with, how much is shared, and how that information is stored. It is infinitely more secure and requires blockchain technology to build. Importantly, blockchain-based identity solutions look like any other identity solution. This underlying technology, security-by-default, and complex self-sovereign architecture are all operating at the back-end, meaning a change in infrastructure is invisible to the end user. What the industry is currently missing is a mainstream tool that is so ingrained that users don’t know it’s there until asked to take charge of their digital identities. 2019 will undoubtedly witness an emergence of new tools that can not only transform the way customers are on-boarded but bring the concept of self-sovereign identity to life. However, the benefits must be two-fold. The identity verification process for businesses needs to be streamlined and provide clear value in time and cost savings, while placing control back in the hands of individuals.",Guest Contributors,"March 22, 2019, 08:33:54 AM EDT",Beyond the Identity Honeypot: How Blockchain Can Transform E-Commerce KYC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
82,"Shutterstock photo Sometimes, you need to write the article because the event is too big to ignore. That doesn’t mean that you are required to understand exactly what happened, or why, however, which is good, because the cryptocurrency market is a little mysterious at the best of times. A look at the data on CoinWatch.com shows that this week has seen one of the big events. We now find ourselves in an anomalous position, with Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market generally, of trying to explain a massive spike in value. What happened was this: Cryptocurrencies jumped, with the total crypto market cap gaining almost 11% on Tuesday, April 1. Bitcoin (BTC), whose $88.20 billion market cap makes up slightly more than 50% of crypto’s total, drove the rally by adding 18% that day. Other crypto coins also showed gains, with Ripple (XRP) adding 13% and Ethereum (ETH) putting on 16%. Together, these three coins make up some 80% of the cryptocurrency market. Some Possible Reasons Initial reports, circulated by Bloomberg, suggested that an April Fool’s joke may have contributed. A widely circulated article, which turned out to be a prank, said that the SEC had approved bitcoin-backed exchange trade funds. As with many “facts” that sound too good to be true, this one wasn’t. But it did make the rounds before it was debunked. The prank-gone-right theory just doesn’t seem plausible. In fact, it even seems like a prank. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said of the prank rumor: “It's absurd to believe this market move is the result of confusion about the Bitcoin ETF filings. Though ETFs and April Fools are topical, there are lots of reasons this is an unlikely explanation.” What seems more reasonable is that Bitcoin, which was designed from its beginning to be both scarce and non-renewable, faced a sudden shortage. The networked virtual mining operations that produce bitcoins have slowed down over the past year as crypto went through its price collapse. That slowdown makes an impact in a market that normally shows low trading volumes – typically between 75 and 125 million BTC per day. And trading volumes brings us to another point: trading activity in the bitcoin exchanges spiked sharply in tandem with the jump in value. This chart, tracking Bitcoin’s daily trading volume, shows how the market looked from March 1 through April 4. The spikes in trading volume on April 2 and 3, reaching well above 800 million, are clearly visible:  The usual low trading volumes, however, make cryptos vulnerable to sudden variations. Per Reuters, an anonymous trader placed a major buy order on Tuesday, totaling more than $100 million. The move triggered a surge in value, which in turn drew in more traders, and initiated an upward spiral of price and trading. Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital crypto bank said, in a note addressed to its clients, “Over the last few weeks, some degree of complacency and dealer positioning had left the market vulnerable to an explosive upside move.” A Good Month for Crypto? Whatever the cause, the fact remains that Bitcoin has now shown gains for 6 weeks in a row. While this is not unprecedented in the history cryptocurrency trading, it has been well over a year since Bitcoin last showed such an extended run of gains. Whether or not the gains will prove durable is another matter, but cryptocurrency analysts are cautiously optimistic on the issue. Brian Kelly, the well-known Bitcoin bull, sees plenty of support for the cryptocurrency in this rally: “You’re starting to see a fair amount of institutional interest in this. And by institutional, I mean even high net worth individuals, family offices are starting to take a serious interest… There’s quite a bit going on under the surface.” Thomas Lee, of Fundstrat, also sees this rally persisting, for reasons made clear in technical analysis: “Definitely a positive development that Bitcoin is now above its 200-day moving average.” As for the other cyptocurrencies, both Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) are now down from their Tuesday peaks. Ripple is trading at $0.33, down 7% since Tuesday, while Ethereum stands at $161, for a two-day loss of 2%.

83,"By Chandler Song, Co-Founder and CEO of Ankr ​In just a few short years, the sharing economy has become a ubiquitous concept—one that is unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. The meteoric rise of tech heavyweights such as Uber and Airbnb has ushered in a new era of purchasing habits and views of ownership, disrupting industries such as public transport and real estate with lightning speed. Projected to grow to $335 billion in 2025, the sharing economy has the ability to radically transform and better democratize even the latest technological advancements, take cloud computing, for example. This could lead to greater efficiencies, access, and lower costs while challenging the existing monopoly of cloud services by comparatively traditional tech conglomerates such as Amazon and Microsoft. Powered by the cloud The underlying concepts that eventually gave rise to cloud computing can be traced back to the early days of the Internet in the 90s. As a service offering, its arrival into the tech sector was marked by the release of Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud product in 2006, followed by the company’s subsequent creation of its Amazon Web Services arm, while other players such as Google and NASA began offering cloud computing products in 2008. From that point forward, the cloud computing sector has undergone multiple transformations in the last ten years, giving rise to more enterprise-ready, tailored solutions. Today, cloud computing can be broken down into three main services: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). While each type of cloud platform has its own unique advantages and use cases, at a basic level each offers the universal benefits that come with sharing computing resources, including scalability, ease of use, lowered costs, burgeoning ecosystems, and access to the latest technology. Having surpassed a state of nascency and gone on to achieve mainstream success, the question for businesses is no longer a matter of whether the implementation of cloud is necessary, but rather how or when it’ll take place. Indeed, the development of hybrid cloud solutions and container innovations such as Kubernetes mark the next phase of cloud adoption where enterprises have the option to better adapt cloud solutions to their needs, now able to blend both public and private cloud resources by moving their workloads into a multi-cloud environment. It is clear that cloud computing has revolutionized the way software and services are developed and delivered, while simultaneously bringing technology, businesses, and people together at a level of collaboration that is foreign to such a fiercely competitive industry. With a market share that is expected to reach $555 billion by 2020, the cloud services market has seen astounding growth, for reasons that parallel some of the principles behind the sharing economy—providing convenient, on-demand access without the cost and complexity of acquiring or managing the underlying technology. With the myriad of offerings that exist today, companies of varying sizes and differing needs can tailor their cloud computing solutions to meet their needs as they transition to a more digital interface. Facing the giants While enterprises can undoubtedly reap huge benefits from implementing cloud computing solutions, they come with certain drawbacks as well. According to statistics by Synergy Research Group, there is a massive imbalance in the cloud computing market share. In 2017, the top five giants—Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Google, and Alibaba—owned a combined market share of almost 75% of the entire public cloud market. This is a result of these tech conglomerates purposefully targeting enterprise users to move their workloads onto the cloud. While increased adoption is a good thing, it also means that companies may implement solutions without a real understanding or without really identifying a clear need. Their market dominance also comes at the expense of the small-to-medium sized cloud operators who, lacking the scale and financial muscle of these leaders, are unable to keep pace with their larger competitors. The existing monopoly of cloud computing services can also significantly impact the ability of smaller businesses to implement such solutions, by making access to the cloud incredibly expensive. As the technology continues to develop, enterprises will also need to upskill their workers accordingly. In addition to that, there are several other concerns surrounding the long-term viability for cloud implementation, ranging from security, to cost management. Though enterprise adoption of cloud computing continues to rise, companies are forced to confront the reality that mounting costs and growing technological sophistication could ultimately hinder long-term implementation. An inclusive economy With the proliferation of the sharing economy, distributed cloud computing has emerged as a way to tackle the limitations of today’s centralized cloud and mitigate rising costs while monetizing existing resources, leading to greater profits. It can also lead to improved security, when the distributed aspect is paired with other technologies such as blockchain in order to build a decentralized network. Until the advent of distributed technology, immense amounts of idle computing power have remained untapped worldwide. As more and more computers, smartphones, and other devices come online, the amount of idle power will grow too. The concepts of decentralization and a sharing economy can help tackle the growing issue of cloud waste, by allowing enterprises and personal users to feed their idle computing resources into a shared marketplace. By taking advantage of these underutilized resources from individuals across the globe, we will be able to yield tremendous computing power to support the rising demand, without having to rely on one central hub that can be easily exploited or monopolized. Transitioning to a more digitized state of operations and storage should be a step forward that all enterprises, big or small, should be able to take; by disrupting the cloud computing sector with a sharing economy model, a wider range of businesses will be able to leverage the benefits of the cloud without fears of skyrocketing costs, while simultaneously democratizing access to this solution as a whole.",Guest Contributors,"March 22, 2019, 08:30:21 AM EDT",Disrupting the Disruptors: Transforming the Cloud Computing Market,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1

85,"By Landon Manning The federal government of the Commonwealth of Australia announced this month that it would begin a major initiative to sponsor the development of blockchain technology. Karen Andrews, Australia’s Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, claimed that $100,000 AUD ($70,900 USD) would be allocated to “nurture a ‘burgeoning’ industry,” according to iTnews. Also noteworthy is that this announcement came barely a month after the country’s Digital Transformation Agency formally recommended that the government take a more cautious approach to distributed ledger technology adoption, following an inquiry into the matter requested by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Nevertheless, the federal government is proceeding with an investment plan, and the roadmap for development specifically mentions a focus on “regulation, skills and capacity building, innovation, investment and international competitiveness and collaboration,” with the eventual goal of making Australia a global leader in blockchain technology. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) will be partnering with private blockchain company Data61 — which has previously worked with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). The CBA has shown a particular interest in blockchain technology on multiple occasions, in addition to its new partnership. In July 2018, for example, it partnered with five domestic and international supply chain companies to track a multi-ton shipment of almonds from Australia to Germany. The potential to improve international supply chains is a common use case for blockchain technology, so it seems natural that a government institution would use this as a possible test ground for distributed ledgers. Much of the preliminary phase of development on this project will be focused on gathering academic and industry experts to make a roadmap for Australia’s path forward. Much of the $100,000 AUD will be used “to bankroll attendance by Australian companies at Austrade’s third Mission to Consensus in New York in May,” an event that Andrews called “a landmark event for the blockchain industry.” While there, Australian companies will be able to show off their talents to a diverse range of international users, not to mention investors. Simon Birmingham, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, stated that this event “will present significant opportunities for Australian tech companies to showcase their products on the world-stage.” He added, “It is vital Australia and our tech companies stay ahead of the game in one of the world’s fastest growing technology sectors.”",Bitcoin Magazine,"March 22, 2019, 08:22:37 AM EDT",Australian Government to Nurture Blockchain Technology With Major Investment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Read more on five of those efforts below. Doubling down on international growth During the two days at Netflix's Los Angeles offices, one   number came up over and over again: Only 5% of the world's   population are native English speakers. ""Historically, we've seen   the large majority of international content be produced right   here in Hollywood in English,"" said Netflix chief product officer   Greg Peters. ""And it's in that disconnect that we see a   tremendous opportunity, because we believe that great stories   should be able to come from anywhere on the planet."" Netflix's strategy to reach the other 95% of the world is to   produce local content, and then find global audiences for that   content. Peters named ""La Casa de Papel,"" ""Sex Education,""   ""Dark,"" and ""The Rain"" as some of the service's international   success stories. ""All these shows are popular in their own   country, but they're also traveling and finding audiences around   the world,"" he said. ""Audiences that would've most likely never   experienced these kind of shows before."" Key to those efforts is Netflix's focus on dubbing. ""We want   to provide entertainment to everybody around the world, no matter   what you speak, where you live, where you're from, what you eat,""   said the company's international dubbing director Debra Chinn.   Her team has been rolling out dubbed versions of Netflix's   content in up to 27 languages, including English - a particular   challenge, since native English-language speakers typically   aren't used to dubbed content. ""We are taking this new initiative   very seriously,"" Chinn said.  The art of dubbing, as demonstrated by Netflix to     journalists this week.  Going short, and out-of-order Netflix may be best known for binge-watching, with its app   conveniently starting the next episode as soon as you have   finished one. However, Netflix VP of product Todd Yellin   suggested this week that the company may mix things up a bit in   the future. ""How about anthologies? How about something like   'Chef's Table'?"" he asked. ""You don't have to watch it in the   order that we tell you to."" Yellin also quoted the company's latest animated sci-fi   anthology ""Love, Death & Robots"" as a perfect example of a   show that can be watched in any particular order - which is   exactly what the company is experimenting with through a special   episode picker right on your TV home page. ""Some members will get   a special row, and that row will have all the different, let's   call them animated shorts for grownups, from 'Love, Death &   Robots,'"" he said.  Some Netflix members get to see a special episode picker     for the service's new show ""Love, Death & Robots.""  The show is also notable for being an experiment in brevity.   ""Some of them are five minutes long. Some of them are 17 minutes   long,"" Yellin said. ""Why should we be constrained by the amount   of time? With internet TV, the schedule is yours."" But while Jeffrey Katzenberg and   others are rediscovering short-form    as a mobile-driven video format, Yellin was quick to emphasize   that the length of a show was purely a creative decision for   Netflix. ""It's really about flexibility in storytelling. Some   stories are best told in six minutes and some stories are best   told in 10 hours,"" he said in an interview with   Variety    . The flip side of this line of thinking is that Netflix may do   more short-form content over time if the right project comes   along. Said Yellin: ""We're experimenting with short-form, and   we'll see if it works."" Making shows and movies look and sound their best Six-hundred unique devices access Netflix every month,   according to Peters. And in February, out of those 600 million,   125 million were HDR-capable. ""That's an amazing adoption rate of   a new video format that we are enabling by working both with the   creative community and with our device partners,"" Peters   said. In addition to embracing HDR for its own productions, the   streaming service is also increasingly using Dolby Atmos to   enable a theater-like in-home audio experience. ""The sound of a   movie is another character, is another performer in the show,""   said ""Lost in Space"" showrunner and executive producer Zack   Estrin, who argued that this was also true for shows without big   soundscapes, like comedies. ""If you feel the laughter around you   as opposed to just on that wall, it feels like you are in the   audience,"" Estrin said. But while Netflix has benefited from new audio and display   technologies, it also has to deal with some of the downsides.   This includes default settings for TVs that are optimized for   brightness, and not necessarily accuracy. ""Most TVs tend to   over-brighten the color,"" said Netflix post tools integration   manager Richard Smith. ""Bright shiny objects, bright shiny   objects - that's not what we want,"" added Estrin.  Sony's latest TV set, compared to a studio reference     monitor made by the company.  As a remedy for overly bright screens, Netflix has been   working with select display makers on a dedicated setting to   restore accuracy. This ""Netflix Calibrated Mode"" was first added   to select Sony TVs last year. This year, the company is going to   team up with other TV makers to add it to their devices as well,   but company representatives weren't ready to share the names of   those TV makers just yet. Infusing the production process with 21st-century   technology As Netflix continues its shift toward original content, the   company is also exploring ways to make content production more   efficient. Netflix has a dedicated team that has been building   apps and services for the production process, including a   contacts manager, a distribution tool that helps to update an   entire crew with the latest version of call sheets and other   important documents, and   an app called Move that    helps track the schedule of a production. Netflix is gradually introducing these tools to the production   process, said studio technology director Amie Tornincasa. ""We   start small, with seeds."" The best approach was not to replace   all of the technology that a production is using with a whole new   set of tools, but integrate with their workflow and improve   things from there. In 2017, Netflix tested some of its new tools   with 10 different productions. In 2018, 40 productions made use   of at least some of the apps and services developed by   Tornincasa's team.  Netflix's new script markup tool.  This year, Netflix wants to start testing a new tool that   helps production teams mark up a script, and enable them to move   away from pen, paper, and highlighter. ""We want to take the   script and turn it into an interactive breakdown tool,"" said   content engineering product director Chris Goss. Helping Netflix users find new gems Netflix frequently tests new iterations of its TV and mobile   interfaces, and Hastings made it clear this week that his   company's work on perfecting that experience is far from done.   ""It's a little bit too much like the classified ads and not   enough like a magazine,"" he said about Netflix's current   interface. Yellin also readily admitted that the company can do better,   for instance when it comes to showing the right content to the   right person in the right way. ""As we've moved increasingly to   original content, it's content that they've never heard of   before,"" Yellin told   Variety    . ""So we have to get them excited."" Netflix has for some time personalized images to present the   same show in different ways to different audiences. Now, it is   also testing personalizing text descriptions and even tags, said   Yellin: ""Different tags work for different people,"" he said.  Netflix also relies on tagging to personalize the curation     of its shows.  Even the videos shown as part of Netflix's interface are   increasingly being personalized. For instance, Netflix cuts   different trailers of its originals and shows them to different   audiences, said Yellin. And later this year, it will test videos   fine-tuned to tell the story of a kids show's character in its   own voice to younger viewers.  ""They're shorter, they're in the character's voice and they're   focused on the character,"" explained Netflix TV product   innovation director Cameron Johnson. ""They're not telling you the   full arc of the story, they're just saying: This is who this   character is."" Netflix has also been running tests to adapt the size of cover   art in its interface based on personalization. However, Yellin   added that the company has been carefully weighing the amount of   content shown to each viewer as they browse Netflix's catalog -   even if the optimal result may not look like a glossy magazine.   ""Newspapers existed for a couple of centuries by running   classified ads, and it was really important to them,"" he joked in   response to Hastings' comments.

88,"Shutterstock photo Technology stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) delivered strong first-quarter performances with semiconductors acting as one of the integral drivers of technology strength in the first three quarters of the year. Consider the following: the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index gained 16.20 percent in the first quarter, but the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) surged 20.40 percent during that period. The $1.14 billion SOXX tracks the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index, one of the most widely followed gauges of semiconductor stocks. That means SOXX has already wiped out its 2018 loss of 6.50 percent and much more. While the rally in technology stocks has boosted valuations on the group, some analysts believe chip stocks are not yet too stretched on valuation and see opportunities within the group. “Despite the recent rally in tech and in semiconductors specifically, we still think semis are the most undervalued subsector in technology, as about 30 percent of our coverage is 4-star-rated or higher and the median chip stock is about 4 percent below our fair value estimate,” said Morningstar in a note out Monday. To that point, multiples on SOXX are not far off those of the broader market. The semiconductor ETF has a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.63x, according to issuer data. Innovation Is Important The technology sector is rife with disruptive, innovative products and services and semiconductors often serve as the backbones of those themes. Semiconductor makers are at the epicenter of potentially transformative themes, such as 5G and artificial intelligence (AI). “Semiconductor suppliers are potential early winners from this ongoing shift,” according to BlackRock. “They are set to benefit from a significant increase in demand for the data and infrastructure required to handle the network traffic. Fiber and testing companies also stand to benefit as 5G infrastructure is built out and new 5G applications are tested.” Another potential tailwind for SOXX and some of the 30 stocks residing the in chip ETF is easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. In fact, that was an important driver of semiconductor stocks' performance in the first three months of the year. “However, a good portion of the bounce-back in semis in the first quarter came from optimism about easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as some commentary suggesting that the March quarter will be a bottom for chip demand,” said Morningstar. Another fertile territory for chip is the global automotive market, which is expected to boost demand for processing chips over the next several years, as highlighted by the chart below. Courtesy: Morningstar Catalysts For SOXX As noted above, SOXX holds 30 stocks. The fund devotes over 19 percent of its combined weight to NVIDIA Copr. (NVDA) and Broadcom Corp. (AVGO). Some of the fund's other marquee components could also contribute to upside for SOXX as 2019 moves along. That includes Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), the seventh-largest holding in SOXX at 4 percent of the ETF's weight. “We believe wide-moat Applied Materials' shares are trading at an attractive discount,” said Morningstar. “The company has benefited greatly from the sharp rise in spending by memory and display chipmakers over the past few years, though recent customer commentary suggests a near-term pullback in spending for each subsegment (especially in 3D NAND memory and OLED displays). Although we think total wafer front end spending will be modestly lower in 2019, we foresee Applied leveraging the breadth of its product portfolio and services business to navigate this softer demand.” Morningstar star has a fair value estimate of $49 on shares of Applied Materials, indicating potentially significant upside from current levels of around $42.60.",Todd Shriber,"April 03, 2019, 02:54:11 PM EDT",Semiconductor ETFs Remain Compelling Bets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

96,"With Lyft's IPO, there is increased attention on the rapidly growing ridesharing business, even though it is unprofitable. The fundamental issue facing Lyft, as well as Uber, is how will it compete against or use autonomous ride services. Will it become a blockbuster in this new industry or displaced by new technology, just as Blockbuster Video was? Blockbuster Video was a hot stock to own in the 1990s with rapid growth, reaching almost $6 billion in revenue in 2003. Netflix began competing using its mail-based subscription model and then introduced streaming video in 2007. Blockbuster could not compete with streaming video, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2010. In my previous Seeking Alpha articles, I explained the advantages of autonomous ride services (essentially Uber or Lyft without a driver) over ridesharing. Here we will look at the implications on Lyft and its ARS strategy, but first, let's review an updated business model comparison that was introduced in a previous article -- Uber Must Have Autonomous Ride Services ( https://seekingalpha.com/article/4200188-uber-must-autonomous-ride-services ) A business model defines the fundamental way a business works in economic or financial terms. It is a basic element of strategy. A business model is not intended to be precise; it's directionally correct. It's not a financial projection, even though it frequently appears as one. It uses financial projections to illustrate directionally how the business works. Let's compare the business models for ridesharing and autonomous ride services, modeling them on the income and costs for a typical trip.  The business model projected for ridesharing starts with data from Lyft and Uber and then projects some improvements. It uses revenue and cost for a 7-mile trip, which from many estimates is a typical Lyft or Uber trip. The price per-trip varies widely based on the time of the day, drive time, and distance. However, a 7-mile trip for $16.00 (approximately $2.30 per mile) is reasonably representative of a typical Lyft or Uber trip. The driver cost uses the percentages from Lyft's and Uber's recent revenue statements. For example, Lyf t report ed $8.1 billion in bookings with a $5.9 billion or 73.4% driver cost in its S-1. Of Uber's $12 billion in quarterly billings, $9.2 billion (approximately 76%) went to its drivers and related expenses. The remainder of the ridesharing cost estimates come directly from the percentages in their respective financial statements. They classify operating expenses somewhat differently, so the total operating expense is the best comparison. Using these ratios, both Lyft and Uber report losses on every trip, just as they do overall in their financial statements. The ridesharing projected model averages the driver cost between the two services. It also assumes operating expense improvements with increased economies of scale. It also assumes a significant reduction in R&D costs since much of the current R&D is going toward developing autonomous vehicles. With these projections, ridesharing is approximately breakeven. In the modeling for ARS, I use an average of $1.35 per mile, so that the 7-mile trip will be $9.45. This is approximately 40% less than a comparable ridesharing price for the same trip. ARS pricing will vary too. Initially, it may be closer to ridesharing pricing since it will be capacity constrained, but when ARS competitors have local fleets of 1,000 or more vehicles then prices will be reduced. The overhead costs for the ARS model include similar operations costs and R&D (which would be about $3 billion per year allocated across all ARS vehicles). The end result in this model is an operating income estimate of 25%. The ARS business model is significantly more profitable, even at a much lower price per trip. There are no driver related costs in the ARS model since there are no drivers. Instead, there are significant capital costs from investment in autonomous ride services vehicles. In my research, I estimate that a typical ARS vehicle will make 50 trips per day (Waymo uses the same estimate), for 350-days-per-year, with a 7-mile per trip average. Each vehicle will generate approximately $150,000 per year in revenue. I estimate the operating cost per vehicle at over $52,000 per year. This includes fuel, insurance, taxes, maintenance and cleaning ($20,000/year), and depreciation ($20,000/year). This would yield a 60% return on investment for a $100,000 ARS vehicle. Readers of some of my previous articles were skeptical of the 50 trip per day assumption for autonomous ride services, so I also included a much lower 30 trip per day projection. This still shows a much more competitive and profitable model than ridesharing with an operating profit of 22% but a lower, although still viable, return on investment of 34%. ARS could charge a higher price per trip and be even more profitable. Competition for ARS could force the price per trip even lower, but this lower price will most likely expand the market even faster, and increase vehicle utilization. I modeled a lower cost-per-trip of $6, which is 65% less than the price of an Uber trip. At this price point, assuming somewhat higher demand and utilization, the ARS model is still profitable. The fundamental strategic difference in these business models is the well-proven examples throughout history; technology and capital-intensive business models displace labor-intensive business models. When this happens, the labor-intensive model loses every time. At almost half the price per trip, ARS is much more profitable. Ridesharing is not yet profitable, and it cannot hope to be viable at these lower competitive prices. ARS will eventually displace ridesharing. One can argue about the timeframe for this. Is it going to start in two years or four years? Will ARS take 20% of the ridesharing market by 2025 or 50% of it? Regardless of timeframe, the conclusion is inevitable: ARS will eventually displace ridesharing. Autonomous ride services will become a very large market. Ridesharing is currently a large market and growing rapidly. ARS will displace ridesharing over time and also accelerate the market because of much lower prices per trip. ARS will be a geographic market, not a global market . It is a services market, not a product market. Approximately a half-dozen major companies are expected to compete for that market in the U.S., rolling out their ARS services by metropolitan areas. Waymo, a subsidiary of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ), is the first to market. Cruise Automation ( GM ) is expected to follow in 2019. Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC ( F ) is planning on launching its ARS services in 2021. ARS is crucial for Uber ( UBER ) and Lyft ( LYFT ) because it will cannibalize their ridesharing business. They need to compete in this market or eventually face extinction, but they are both behind in developing autonomous vehicles. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), is the wildcard in the ARS market. It has yet to declare its intentions, but it is investing heavily in AV development and testing, and the ARS market is the only one that makes sense for it. The advantage that Lyft and Uber may have in entering the ARS market is that they already have popular ridesharing apps. They can simply add an ARS service to their apps and riders can choose what they want. Others will need to get customers to use their apps to request a ride, but that may not be a substantial problem when ARS comes into a metropolitan area. The Uber and Lyft brands name may be an advantage, but it's hard to rely on a brand name as a differentiator. Lyft is investing in developing autonomous vehicles, but not as much as Uber, Waymo, Apple, Cruise Automation or Ford. Its strategy appears to rely on the technology development of others. Lyft's strategy is focused on building a network of partnerships. Lyft describes its two-pronged autonomous vehicle strategy in its S-1 as follows: Pioneering Autonomous Vehicle Strategy. We are investing in autonomous technology and employ a two-pronged strategy to bring autonomous vehicles to market. Our Open Platform provides market-leading developers of autonomous vehicle technology access to our network to enable their vehicles to fulfill rides on our platform. Simultaneously, we are building our own world-class autonomous vehicle system at our Level 5 Engineering Center, with the goal of ensuring access to affordable and reliable autonomous technology. We believe that the strength of our brand, our trusted relationships with riders and our expertise in operating a ridesharing network at scale, as well as our two-pronged strategy to bring autonomous vehicles to market, will be competitive advantages that will enable us to capture value in the emerging autonomous vehicle ecosystem. Lyft has several strategic partnerships that may offer access to autonomous vehicles. Its Open Platform partnership with Aptiv has enabled the commercial deployment of a small fleet of autonomous vehicles on its platform in Las Vegas. The success of Lyft's strategy of partnering with others providing the autonomous vehicles for ARS is risky. This strategy relies on partners that have invested billions in developing autonomous driving technology giving Lyft control over riders and letting Lyft take a significant portion of the ARS rider fees. A few years ago, this seemed like a good strategy, and there were many partnerships, but then these companies realized that control of the autonomous ride services platform would dictate who made money. So, then they went off to develop their own ride services. Waymo decided to have its own platform, Waymo One. Then Ford and GM spun-off their own ARS businesses It seems like this may not be evolving as Lyft intended. So, Lyft was forced to increase its own AV development investment. Lyft appears to acknowledge the inevitability of autonomous ride services and discloses the problem of not having an AV partner as a risk. If we are unable to efficiently develop our own autonomous vehicle technologies or develop partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. With its IPO, Lyft will have the financial resources to last for years even with continuing losses in ridesharing. It won't have sufficient financial resources to develop and launch autonomous ride services. It could possibly acquire a small company to accelerate its autonomous vehicle development, but it won't have the immense capital required to create autonomous fleets for ARS. I previously saw Lyft as a potential acquisition candidate, but at the expected valuation, this is less likely. It will be a little bit like someone buying a mansion on the ocean and then tearing it down to build another house. It's not rational but could happen. It will be too expensive for GM and Ford to acquire Lyft. Google could acquire it to combine with Waymo, but may not need to do that. In any case, Lyft's voting structure will discourage potential acquirers. So, the fundamental questions for investors in Lyft revolve around its strategy for autonomous ride services. Just like streaming video displaced video rental, ARS will replace ridesharing. Investing in Lyft should really be done as an investment in its longer-term strategy for autonomous ride services compared to its expected competitors.

99,"Valued at a mouthwatering $31 billion, Airbnb is now hinting that it might not IPO this year after all—but sometimes it’s better to wait to iron out a few kinds when you’re a startup that is responsible for nothing short of revolutionizing travel. ""We have already said that we are taking the steps to be ready to go public in 2019. That doesn't mean we will go public in 2019,"" Nathan Blecharczyk, an Airbnb cofounder, told Business Insider in an email interview. Just like Uber has been plagued with stories of rape, murder, theft and the like, Airbnb has its share of unfortunate events. There are always problems in the evolutionary chain, and in this case, expanding your travel options means sacrificing a layer of security, safety and accountability that would have with a hotel. The most recent upset was the publicity around the confession of the murder this week of a guest by an Airbnb host in Melbourne, Australia in 2017, when the host realized he was short $149 to pay his bill. The host, 42-year-old Jason Colton, has been sentenced to prison for 11 years after copping to manslaughter and testifying that he hadn’t meant to kill his guest; rather, he had sought to render him unconscious. The guest, 36-year-old Ramis Jonuzi, was attacked in the home by Colton and two others who beat and strangled him to death. Airbnb has over five million listings on offer, and it’s not feasible to do security-related background checks on every property owner, especially when those listings span the globe. All you can rely on for accountability is user reviews. It’s an evolutionary leap of faith—and one that we really should be able to take. Still, the stories of murder and mayhem don’t help when a startup is so close to going public. In December 2018, a security guard at an Airbnb villa in Costa Rica was arrested for the murder of a Florida woman who had been staying there. Her body was found in the woods near the villa, with evidence that the cause of death was blunt force trauma. The month before, a couple vacationing in Mexico died of carbon monoxide poisoning in their Airbnb rental thanks to a faulty heater. This latter incident is less likely to happen in the U.S. because Airbnb hands out free carbon monoxide detectors to anyone who asks for them, and the laws in the U.S. require all homes to have these detectors, so Airbnb requires all property owners to have them in order to be listed. In the meantime, investors are growing increasingly anxious at the prospects of an Airbnb IPO, and many are likely still holding out for that to happen this year. But Airbnb still has a few things it wants to do, apparently, before going public. This year already, Airbnb has acquired Gaest and HotelTonight. The HotelTonight acquisition will give Airbnb another chance to increase growth and diversity because it adds an app for selling last-minute, unused inventory at boutique and independent hotels. Valued at $463 million in March 2017, HotelTonight is believed to be worth far more now. What’s up next? Possibly an investment in India. Reports have emerged this week that it may be planning to back an Indian hotel startup called Oyo to the tune of up to $200 million. The Indian startup is tearing it up lately—it’s even backed by SoftBank’s Vision Fund. So, what about the IPO? Airbnb clearly has more acquisitions in mind to bolster its position before going public, so the overriding sentiment is that it’ll wait until 2020.

102," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips We are now at the halfway point between last year's iPhone event and the announcement of the 2019 iPhones, which is expected in mid-September. And we're already beginning to see details emerge about the 2020 iPhones … Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may be focused on services like Apple TV+ at the moment, but the reality is that AAPL revenue and Apple stock remain tied to the iPhone.  And a series of leaks from the supply chain suggest the company is pulling out all the stops in an effort to reverse the current slide in iPhone sales, including big moves in 2019 and next year. Apple helped to popularize the multi-camera setup that has become a standard in current smartphones - with the exception of Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Pixels series. But the two-camera system AAPL introduced with the iPhone 7 Plus is now falling behind the competition. Samsung'snew Galaxy S10 features a triple camera and Huawei's P30 Pro has four cameras. Apple is reportedly working on a triple camera system for the 2019 version of the iPhone Max. That is expected to deliver 3X optical zoom, and could also offer enhanced 3D sensing for augmented reality applications and better low light performance. Apple killed the AirPower wireless charging mat that was announced at the 2018 iPhone launch. However, the company still has wireless charging ambitions. The 2019 iPhones will reportedly feature two-way wireless charging . This means the iPhone itself could charge AAPL's latest AirPods wireless earbuds simply by setting the AirPods case on the iPhone's back. To make two-way wireless charging more practical, Apple is expected to also boost the battery capacity for the 2019 iPhones. Sounds good, but this feature was also a part of the latest Galaxy S10. The latest big iPhone rumor skips 2019 to focus on the 2020 iPhones. According to a report this morning in Taiwan's Digitimes (via 9to5 Mac ) Apple is planning to move to all-OLED iPhones next year. That has previously been reported by The Wall Street Journal . However, Digitimes has a new wrinkle that suggests the company could be up-sizing. Rumblings from Apple's supply chain point to 5.42-inch, 6.06-inch and 6.67-inch panels. That would give the 2020 Max model the largest-ever display in an iPhone, and assuming the middle size is the iPhone XR successor, it would mean the iPhone XS equivalent shrinks from the current 5.8-inch display. A smaller iPhone would help with customers who don't want a smartphone so large it requires two hands to operate - a segment AAPL largely abandoned when it discontinued the iPhone SE. Going all-in on OLED would give Apple premium quality displays across its entire lineup, and help to reduce the bezels on the iPhone XR. But those OLED displays are the single most expensive component in an iPhone , and that's going to put price (or profit margin) pressures on Apple.  Apple helped to kick off the smartphone era with the iPhone in 2007. A decade of record-setting iPhone launches drove Apple stock to stratospheric levels while setting the design trends that other smartphone manufacturers followed. Now AAPL finds itself in the position of playing catch up. The 2019 iPhones may be the best yet, but Apple isn't expected to offer capabilities the competition will be heavily promoting, including 5G support and the option of a folding smartphone . Key upgrades this year - including a triple camera system and pass-through wireless charging - will be seen as trying to keep pace with the competition. That will make it tougher for AAPL to continue its strategy of boosting iPhone prices to keep revenue growing when unit sales are slipping. The question is, will Apple's moves in 2019 and 2020 be enough to stabilize and even grow iPhone revenue over the next few years while the company continues to expand its services? If so, that's good news for AAPL investors. If not, the continued reliance on iPhone revenue could spell bad news for Apple stock. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s. The post Will Apple's New iPhones Be Too Far Behind? appeared first on InvestorPlace .

106," By Robert Viglione, CEO of  Horizen Despite the uncertain state of the cryptocurrency market, demand for jobs in blockchain remains at an all-time high. According to a new report by  hired.com , global demand for blockchain engineers is up 517 percent from 2018, with more than  5,700  blockchain jobs currently available on the recruiting website Glassdoor alone. This is certainly welcome news for blockchain’s long-term health; however, it comes with an unfortunate caveat. Currently, there are more jobs available than there are people capable of filling them. As is the case with many emerging industries, aspiring professionals in blockchain don’t have access to the resources required to learn industry-specific skills, leaving job listings open, companies scrambling, and the industry at a loss. As we prepare for the coming year, blockchain projects should make a concerted effort to create educational programs that foster the next generation of blockchain developers. Following the wise words of Benjamin Franklin, “an investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” In many ways, blockchain expertise is a disruptive skill, meaning it’s both fast-growing and hard to find. Blockchain recruiters cast a wide net for every position and only have a limited number of experts in blockchain-focused practice areas (e.g., consumer technology, privacy, or the supply chain) to choose from. For blockchain companies, this is why developing and conducting education programs is so important. By teaching aspiring developers about the intricacies of the decentralized economy, companies can expedite the hiring process, creating a direct link between top-tier talent and their top line. Newer generations of blockchain professionals may take solace in the fact that  42 percent  of colleges and universities have started offering blockchain classes in their curriculums. However, there are still a substantial number of developers, both up-and-coming and experienced, that don’t have access to the time or capital necessary to enroll in expensive postgraduate programs. Offering free or low-cost educational programs may seem fiscally counterproductive on its surface, but blockchain companies upskilling developers are already reaping the benefits of deeper and more diverse talent pools. These educational initiatives can be as simple as asking current employees to hold after-hours programs or online classes, and the results will have a lasting impact on both the company and the industry at large. Some projects are already setting an important precedent here. B9lab Academy has launched online coursework that deals with the nuances of the Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Tezos protocols and development.  Truffle, a smart contract suite, has created Truffle University, a training program purposed to help software developers become professional blockchain engineers. At Horizen, we recently announced the Horizen Academy, a comprehensive educational experience focused on blockchain technology, privacy, and the Horizen platform — all free of charge. By presenting industry-specific material to developers at any skill level, we aim to make radical usability and widespread adoption of privacy protocols a reality. Amid rapid advancements in the blockchain industry, it’s important we don’t lose sight of the fact that talent remains our most important asset. At present,  40 percent  of employees who don’t receive the necessary job training leave their positions within their first year. With this in mind, it’s no wonder that  68 percent  of workers say that professional development is the most important workplace policy that a company can implement. If we truly wish to attract some of the best and brightest minds in the world to this emerging space, we will have to be willing to teach them how to walk before they can run. It may take time and effort, but the results will ultimately pay dividends in the creation of an aspiring generation of developers ready to reimagine the world today with the power of blockchain technology.",Guest Contributors,"March 20, 2019, 01:31:43 PM EDT",The Value of Educating the Next Generation of Blockchain Developers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to this rumor, the three 2020 iPhone devices will all feature OLED screens. It also claims that the devices will come with screen sizes of 5.42 inches, 6.06 inches, and 6.67 inches. The rumor says that the smallest of these devices will be the budget version.

Skid Correction : A new patent reveals possible plans for skid correction from AAPL's self-driving car system , AppleInsider notes. This patent lists two different ways that sensors could be used to determine if a car is not turning properly. These sensors would be under the car and could determine speed and angle of travel. The self-driving system can then use this data to better adjust for skidding, such as in poor weather.

108," If you are one of the investors that feels like you are hearing more and more about the artificial intelligence (AI) investment theme, you are probably right. AI is a prime example of a theme of tomorrow with accessible, practical investment opportunities that are reachable today. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are bolstering the accessibility of AI-related investments. By some estimates, there are more than 40 US-listed ETFs with some AI exposure. A smaller, but growing number are explicitly dedicated to AI and related themes. The Global X Future Analytics Tech ETF (AIQ) is part of that group. AIQ, which turns a year old in May, tracks the Indxx Artificial Intelligence & Big Data Index. Like many AI ETFs, AIQ lacks the lengthy track record many advisors and investors crave when evaluating funds, but growth expectations for AI indicate waiting for these funds to age could mean missed opportunities. “Worldwide spending on artificial intelligence (AI) systems is forecast to reach $35.8 billion in 2019, an increase of 44.0% over the amount spent in 2018,” according to International Data Corp.'s (IDC) recently published Worldwide Semiannual Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide. A Growth Play Many thematic ETFs are chock full of stocks with the growth designation. Some of AIQ's 80 components can be considered growth stocks, but the AI fund's components have an average market value of $80.78 billion, indicating the fund is not a bet on small-cap growth, a rewarding, but often volatile market segment. In fact, some AIQ's holdings, including top 10 components Intel Corp. (INTC), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM), reside in some value indexes. AIQ's price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios of 4.47 and 21.32 are not excessive relative to the comparable metrics of 6.00 and 18.71 on the Nasdaq-100 Index. While AIQ holds some growth stocks, the fund's growth feel is heavily derived from broader AI industry trends. The aforementioned IDC report notes “pending on AI systems will more than double to $79.2 billion in 2022 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.0% over the 2018-2022 forecast period.” Fostering that growth are AI's myriad applications across multiple industries, including financial services, healthcare and retail. “Global spending on AI systems will be led by the retail industry where companies will invest $5.9 billion this year on solutions such as automated customer service agents and expert shopping advisors & product recommendations,” according to IDC. “Banking will be the second largest industry with $5.6 billion going toward AI-enabled solutions including automated threat intelligence & prevention systems and fraud analysis & investigation systems.” Taking Flight Thematic ETFs have the potential to outperform traditional sector funds. Consistently delivering on that potential is what advisors and investors are looking for. This year, AIQ is up 20.92%, topping the Technology Select Sector Index by about 270 basis points. Some data points indicate investors are starting to nibble at AIQ. This month, the AI ETF has seen inflows of $1.55 million, bringing its total assets under management to $39 million. Those flows accompany a March gain of 3.39% for AIQ.",Todd Shriber,"March 20, 2019, 01:27:20 PM EDT",An Idea For The Awesome AI Investment Theme,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
109," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Making predictions and finding next-generation investment ideas are some of the most fun parts of my job. They're also some of the most important. I'm not talking about those internet quizzes that predict the first letter of the person you're going to marry. And I'm certainly not talking about a stranger on the phone who claims to have all the answers to life's questions. I'm talking about analysis-driven predictions based on the past and the present that help us see where the world is headed. These kinds of investment ideas are critical for success. As hockey great Wayne Gretsky said, ""Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been."" To get to the puck before everyone else, I take into account everything I have studied and learned over the years and apply it the future. What trends are set to explode and which will have turned into fads and fizzled out? What industries are clearly moving into their next generation? What major catalysts will occur? The answers to these questions fuel my investment ideas. But I also like to hear from some of the world's greatest innovators and thinkers. Today, I want to focus on Bill Gates - the genius behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). You know who he is. Gates was asked by MIT Technology Review to create a list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies that would change the world as we know it. They didn't necessarily have to be innovations making waves today, but ones that will do so in the years ahead. The article, which he wrote, is titled ""How We'll Invent the Future,"" and I agree with a lot of it. I have little doubt that each of the technologies Gates identified will find their way into modern society. Now here are the six that stood out to me the most.  The ability to predict premature births. A pill that probes your gut. Custom designed cancer vaccines. An electrocardiogram (ECG) that you can wear on your wrist. Just one of those technologies would propel healthcare into the future. So imagine if we could accomplish all four. One out of every 10 children is born premature . That's a staggering statistic to me. While care for preemies has improved dramatically, there is still little we can do to prevent mothers from delivering early when their body tells them it's time. But the advancement of genomics - the study of genomes, or a complete set of DNA - has allowed for more accurate, less expensive, and vitally important blood tests. In fact, a bioengineer from Stanford, Stephen Quake, created a startup called Akna Dx to commercialize a $10 blood test that will screen genes commonly associated with pre-term birth. It is estimated that this or a similar test will be available in the next five years.  This is exactly what it sounds like: You simply swallow a small device that captures images of your insides. The device would then be pulled out using something similar to a string, sanitized, and reused in another patient. No need for anesthesia. The technology, which is being developed by a pathologist and engineer at Massachusetts General Hospital, is currently being used in adults and will begin testing in infants this year. Think about how much earlier doctors could diagnose problems, thereby raising the odds of treating them successfully. I especially love this idea because the gut is the area that doctors typically focus on when attempting to pinpoint a disease - even mental health issues have been related to the gut.  A German startup called BioNTech is working with Genentech to commercialize the first personalized cancer vaccine that would incite the body's natural defenses to destroy sick cells. And it would leave healthy cells completely alone! That is the biggest problem with traditional chemotherapy. I talk about the coming wave of personalized medicine a lot. Treating everyone the exact same is insane. Every person has a different genetic makeup, so drugs and vaccines will have varying effects - good and bad. Tailoring treatments to each individual will lead to much higher success rates. This, my friends, is the future of healthcare: gene-based treatments and vaccines. There is even a technology that allows scientists to ""edit"" genes. Simply delete or change the bad genetic code, and the disease is gone. We're all over these investment ideas in my newsletters , and you should be, too.  Think of an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch or Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) fitness tracker as a true medical device. At the moment, these wearables currently only have a single sensor. An electrocardiogram that you receive from a doctor has 12. The benefits of the extra sensors are extreme. Not only will your smart watch monitor your steps, heart rate, and sleep schedule, it will also keep an eye out for atrial fibrillation, heart attacks, and other cardiac issues. This is all about preventive medicine. We are well on the way. Startup AliveCor received FDA clearance in 2017 for an Apple Watch-compatible band, the KardiaBand , that can detect atrial fibrillation. In 2018, Apple received FDA clearance for an ECG feature that is embedded in its watches. And Withings, a health device company, has also released plans for a similarly equipped watch. Clearly this will be a competitive market, but I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple quickly become a major healthcare player based on its advancements in the technology. The bottom line: Genomics and gene editing are two areas that will change healthcare in the next decade. And I am very excited to see how things play out. My readers have gotten into this space early and stand to make a lot of money on these investment ideas as the technological breakthroughs continue in the years ahead.  Another one of Bill Gates' Breakthrough Technology predictions was Robot Dexterity . Robots can do a lot of things for us: They can order our groceries, clean our floors, build complex machines, and even help doctors perform surgeries. But they have to be specifically programmed to do these things. If we alter variables within the given scenarios, they're left completely dumbfounded. As artificial intelligence continues to improve in the years ahead, it will lead robots to be able to perform the functions they are currently lacking. For example, industrial robots won't just act as an assembly line. They'll be able to move like humans in short, accurate movements. A lot of this will be powered by sensors, which is one of the investment ideas I am following closely in Matt McCall's Investment Opportunities . My subscribers are invested in one of the key players in the space. It's down right now, so there's still plenty of time to get in ahead of what I believe is huge upside in the years ahead.  Imagine a cow-free burger. Some of you may be wondering what in the world I am talking about. Others may have already jumped on the bandwagon. According to the United Nations, 9.8 billion people are expected to be on the planet in 2050. They will consume 70% more food than they did in 2005 - including lots of meat. Raising animals for human consumption is already believed to be one of the worst things for the environment, so how would we feed the world's population? In the future, we'll have lab-grown and plant-based meat alternatives that not only taste like real meat, but also possess the same nutritional value. Plant-based diets are already becoming more popular, and two of the biggest players in the space, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods , could IPO this year. (Bill Gates just so happens to be an investor in both.) Great minds must think alike - if I may say so - because this just so happens to be a prediction I also made in December .  I think it is safe to say that the future is coming quickly, and 2019 is already shaping up to be a great year for innovation. But this is only the beginning. Think of how different life and the world would be to someone born 100 years ago: There are more centenarians around now thanks to advancements in medicine and health. The pace of change has accelerated, and I believe the next 30 years will see similar breakthrough changes. We sit on the verge of a transformation very similar to the technology boom in the 1990s. Right now, there are a handful of innovations in their early stages that will change our world in the way the internet did over two decades ago. The way we work, play, travel, bank, receive healthcare, and entertain ourselves will look completely different than they do now. Smart investors stand to make gains similar to - and possibly even larger than - those fortunes made during the internet boom. Several transformational changes are lining up to produce what I believe will be the best investment ideas and opportunities of our lifetimes. The key is to get in early. And when it comes to mega-trends like the legal marijuana boom, there's still time to get in early - but not much. Huge mergers and IPOs abound in this space right now…emboldened by legalization spreading like crazy across the United States. But you don't want to buy just any old pot stock, of course. You've got to do the homework. And get the timing right . That's exactly what I developed my Cannabis Cash Calendar system to do. I raise it because I am about to announce my next recommendation this Thursday, April 4th. You can get exclusive access to it as soon as it's released to my Investment Opportunities readers. Click here to learn how to get on the list to be notified .

But instead of simply   playing trailers, or the short snippets   Netflix    has been using as teasers on TV devices for some time, Netflix   decided to do special cuts of promotional videos that are   narrated by a show's main character. Viewers may for instance get to hear from ""Hilda,"" the star of   the show of the same name, talk about her love for the   wilderness.

Netflix has also ramped up its spending on   kids content, both licensing shows and producing a number of   originals for children. That strategy seems to be working for the   company: 60 percent of Netflix's audience watches some kids and   family programming every month, according to Netflix kids and   family vice president Melissa Cobb.  Netflix kids and family vice president Melissa Cobb and     Netflix TV product innovation director Cameron Johnson at the     company's Lab Days press event.  Last month, over 50 million profiles streamed something from   Netflix's dedicated kids experience, added Johnson. And as the   streaming service moves from a primary focus of licensed content   around well-known I.P. to original productions with new   characters, discovery needs to change as well, argued Cobb. ""We have more original content now, and we are finding that it   becomes a destination for those new original shows,"" she said.   ""That is really changing the dynamic of the kids profile."" Netflix's efforts to introduce kids to new characters could   also be a reprieve for parents whose offspring has been torturing   them by watching the same episodes of the same show over and over   again. At least that's the hope of Johnson. ""I have kids as well   and I see some of the same patterns,"" he said. ""So I have a   strong incentive to say: how can this product help you find   another favorite show, and another favorite show?"" Johnson and Cobb shared insights into their work as part of   Netflix's Lab Days, a two-day press event held at the company's   Los Angeles offices. Netflix also used the event to announce two   new interactive shows,   ""You vs. Wild"" Starring Bear Grylls    and   the animated children's show ""Battle Kitty.""

That strategy seems to be working for the   company: 60 percent of Netflix's audience watches some kids and   family programming every month, according to Netflix kids and   family vice president Melissa Cobb. Netflix kids and family vice president Melissa Cobb and     Netflix TV product innovation director Cameron Johnson at the     company's Lab Days press event. Last month, over 50 million profiles streamed something from   Netflix's dedicated kids experience, added Johnson. And as the   streaming service moves from a primary focus of licensed content   around well-known I.P. to original productions with new   characters, discovery needs to change as well, argued Cobb. ""We have more original content now, and we are finding that it   becomes a destination for those new original shows,"" she said.   ""That is really changing the dynamic of the kids profile."" Netflix's efforts to introduce kids to new characters could   also be a reprieve for parents whose offspring has been torturing   them by watching the same episodes of the same show over and over   again. At least that's the hope of Johnson. ""I have kids as well   and I see some of the same patterns,"" he said. ""So I have a   strong incentive to say: how can this product help you find   another favorite show, and another favorite show?"" Johnson and Cobb shared insights into their work as part of   Netflix's Lab Days, a two-day press event held at the company's   Los Angeles offices. Netflix also used the event to announce two   new interactive shows,   ""You vs. Wild"" Starring Bear Grylls    and   the animated children's show ""Battle Kitty."" Executives also used the event to talk about   Netflix's approach towards cancelling shows    , and the   reasons Netflix won't be part of Apple's TV   service.

And over the past several months, Netflix has pulled the   plug on all of its Marvel superhero shows,   including ""Jessica Jones,"" ""The Punisher,"" "" Luke Cage""    and   ""Daredevil."" makeArticleAd(); Fans have been in uproar about many of these cancellations.   Particularly the cancellation of ""One Day at a   Time""    has caused a public outcry, with critics lamenting that Netflix   was betraying its own commitment to diversity. Speaking at the same two-day press event as Yellin, Netflix   CEO Reed Hastings made it clear that he wasn't taking pleasure in   cancelling shows either. ""We try to avoid it,"" he said. ""But   sometimes it's no longer a good use of the customer's money."" Netflix has traditionally bucked the trend of sharing the kind   of overnight ratings that have long been a staple of the   television world, with executives arguing that these numbers   didn't matter to the company in the same way as they did to   ad-supported TV networks. Recently, Netflix has shared an   increasing amount of carefully cherry-picked data about some of   its success stories. For instance, on a recent       earnings call    , Netflix executives highlighted that the movie ""Bird Box"" was   expected to   attract 80 million viewers within    four weeks of release. Netflix hasn't shared any similar numbers about cancelled   shows. For ""   One Day at a Time    ,"" the company instead tweeted that ""simply not enough people   watched to justify another season."" Hastings echoed those remarks more generally this week when   asked by   Variety    about Netflix's approach to cancellations, saying some shows were   simply too expensive to keep them running on the service without   a sizable audience. ""We can have small shows that do very well,   we can have expensive shows that do very well,"" he said. The   trouble was if shows, especially the ones costing more, fell   below that mark. ""The only case where we end up cancelling is   where it's pretty expensive and not so much viewing,"" Hastings   said. In other words: it's more or less business as usual for   Netflix when it comes to cancelling shows. Still, that in itself   is notable, simply because Netflix has so many times defied the   rules of the business, be it by eschewing ratings or with the   introduction of binge watching. And then there was the case of ""Arrested Development,"" a show   that struggled on Fox, but that was picked up by Netflix after   the streamer saw a growing audience for previous seasons on its   service. That reversal of fortune led some to believe that   quality TV shows that were doomed to be canceled on network TV   had a better chance to find an audience on Netflix, with good   shows making the cut as fans congregate around them. In reality, ""Arrested Development"" may have been the exception   to prove the rule. Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos   suggested as much in a conversation with   Variety    Monday. ""Some shows grow year on year, but not that many,"" he   said. ""It's happened, but it's not that common."" That's in part due to the ever-growing content catalog of the   service. With Netflix debuting 600 new shows a year, it becomes   that much harder for struggling shows to grow their audience,   said Sarandos. So if something doesn't click right away, it's a   lot less likely that it will become a success story over   time. This means that Netflix will keep breaking the hearts of avid   fans, and letting go of shows that don't spark enough joy for the   rest of its audience - even if the company won't tell us how many   viewers a show had before it got axed.

114," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google division took the wraps off its streaming gaming platform at a GDC 2019 keynote on Tuesday. Formerly known by the code names Project Stream and Project Yeti, the new game service is called Stadia, and it will launch later in 2019. While Alphabet stock was up a percent or so, the big winners appear to be companies that will be needed to support Stadia. Game developer Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ) notched a 3.22% boost, while chip maker Advanced Micro Devices  (NASDAQ: AMD ) shot up nearly 12% after the announcement.  Stadia has the potential to be a game changer (no pun intended) but the real winners in the short term are going to be the companies that Google needs to lean on to make its game streaming platform happen. Leading up to yesterday's Game Developer Conference keynote, we had a pretty good idea of what Google was up to . After all, the company had publicly trialled the experience of playing AAA video games in a browser with its Project Stream , which wrapped up earlier this year. Google's keynote was all about what it has been describing as ""the future of gaming,"" which now has a name and a launch timeframe . Stadia is the official name of Google's new game streaming platform, and the company says it will launch later in 2019 in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Stadia will let players stream video games over the internet to devices running the Chrome web browser, through a Google Chromecast or to a Google Pixel device. No console or gaming PC is required, which would cut costs considerably for players. The company is also releasing a Stadia game controller that links to the service directly over Wi-Fi, and has buttons dedicated to YouTube and Google Assistant. Speaking of Youtube, Google says you'll be able to watch gameplay on its popular video-sharing service, push a button and instantly be able to play the video game. Stadia will r equire a 25Mbps internet connection and promises 4K resolution at 60fps, with plans to eventually offer up to 8K resolution and up to 120fps. The global video game industry was worth $138 billion last year , and it's growing. If Stadia can grab a chunk of that, there is a real payoff for Google, which is why Alphabet stock nudged up 1.17% on the announcement. There is also the potential for game developers to sell to a wider audience, and Google says over 100 game studios already have Stadia development kits. Some game development companies got a serious boost from the Stadia announcement, including Activision Blizzard. Ubisoft Entertainment  (OTCMKTS: UBSFY ) - the publisher of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which was the game tested with Project Stream - also saw a 2.99% bump. The big winner for now though is AMD. To launch Stadia, Google says it is investing in custom GPUs from AMD for its data centers. That's a big, exclusive hardware sale with the potential to keep going well beyond the launch.  While some game developer stocks saw a boost from Google's announcement, there is also uncertainty in the industry. Google is creating its own game studio to release Stadia-exclusive titles and that means competition. Developing for yet another platform means additional costs. Some video game console makers also took a hit. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) held steady, but Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Nintendo (OTCMKTS: NTDOY ) both closed down over 3%. GameStop (NYSE: GME ) has a lot to lose if gaming ditches physical discs for streaming, and it took a 0.99% hit on the day. What was missing from Google's Stadia announcement? Besides Doom Eternal - which will also be available for PC, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch - details on launch titles were thin. Also missing was the cost. We're assuming Google will charge a monthly subscription fee for access to Stadia, and that the optional controller would be sold separately, but there has been no confirmation. What we know now is that Google is angling for a larger cut of the $138 billion video game industry, in a big move that may have significant upside for Alphabet stock. In the meantime, Stadia partners like AMD are reaping the benefits as Google spends to build out the service, while console makers and game sellers watch to see if their business faces a real threat. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s. The post AMD Stock Rockets on Google Stadia Announcement appeared first on InvestorPlace .

115," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips On Friday afternoon, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) did something unusual, but not entirely unexpected. The company officially canceled the AirPower. The company's wireless charger was not a rumor - AAPL announced the product on stage at its 2017 iPhone event. However, after a year and a half of delays and quietly scrubbing AirPower references from its website, Apple threw in the towel. The company released a statement saying the wireless charge mat has been canceled, apologizing to the customers who have been waiting for it.  Given that wireless charging is a prominent feature of recent Apple products, including all new iPhones, the Apple Watch and the AirPods, the misstep is not only embarrassing, but it's also leaving money on the table. Despite the bad PR, Apple stock actually saw a slight rise for Friday afternoon's close. On Friday afternoon, Apple sent an e-mailed statement to TechCrunch , finally conceding defeat on the AirPower wireless charger. ""After much effort, we've concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project. We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward."" That puts an end to the product that AAPL first announced at its 2017 iPhone event . Apple has been moving its mobile products toward wireless charging capability, but it has been several years behind rivals like Samsung in supporting the technology in the iPhone. And while the Apple Watch charges wirelessly, it does so with proprietary magnetic induction technology - not the Qi standard that smartphones (including the iPhone) use. With no wireless charger of its own, Apple was leaving money on the table with every iPhone sold. Customers who wanted to use the convenient feature had to buy a third-party charger. With Apple stock feeling the pressure from slowing iPhone revenue, these add-on sales become even more important. Apple decided to release its own wireless charger, but wanted its version to charge everything - iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods. The company also wanted to set the bar high for ease of use, so products could be set anywhere on the mat (not in designated locations) and they would just start charging. Immediately after the announcement, the AirPower was featured on Apple's website, but the delivery date soon changed to read ""coming in 2018"" and then ""currently unavailable."" After the 2018 iPhone event, the AirPower disappeared from Apple's website altogether, even as AAPL continued to promote the wireless charging capability of its devices. When the second-generation AirPods wireless earbuds were released several weeks ago, the retail box had a picture of the AirPower charging mat . Like any tech company, Apple has products it works on sometimes right up to the prototype stage and then abandons. That is expected. The difference with the AirPower is that the company actually announced the product (at its biggest event of the year), showed off pictures of it, put it on its website, kept people guessing for a year and a half and then cancelled it.  Making the situation far worse is the fact that wireless chargers are mainstream. There are hundreds of them on the market. Samsung offers its own version for the Galaxy smartphones, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google sells one for the Pixel. Third-party companies are in on the action as well. I recently reviewed a Nomad Base Station that will wirelessly charge an iPhone and AirPods, plus an Apple Watch simultaneously. It works flawlessly, although the Apple Watch charger is physically separate from the charge mat. Apple apparently ran into a wall by trying to be too ambitious. The company wanted the AirPower to charge multiple devices simultaneously when placed anywhere on its surface while displaying real-time charge levels of each on a iPhone. That approach reportedly resulted in overheating issues that Apple engineers were unable to overcome. Unfortunately, the public perception is that Apple took a year and a half to try to make a wireless charger - a commodity product - and failed. And it made a big deal about a new product, then killed it. Add to that the fact that it has been trumpeting the wireless charging capability of its products, but has no wireless charger to go with them. The AirPower episode has eroded the public's perception of Apple's design prowess. However, of more immediate concern to AAPL investors is that the lack of a wireless charger means every time the company sells an iPhone or set of AirPods, customers who want the convenience will add a third-party wireless charger to their cart. That's anywhere from $50 to $150 in potential revenue that could have gone toward helping Apple stock weather the iPhone sales decline. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

118,"The boom-and-bust cycle of the memory market has sent Micron (MU) stock cratering as much as 56% from its 52-week high of $64. Semiconductor overcapacity and lowered demand has impacted Micron’s pricing power and profit margins. As such, analysts have had little choice but to reduce their projections for Micron’s earnings and revenue in the coming quarters. And we will see just how accurate these lowered estimates are. The nation’s largest memory manufacturer is set to report second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings after the closing bell Wednesday. While the lowered bar should help the company meet or beat its estimates, that might not be enough to change negative sentiment about the health of the memory chip market. Softening DRAM prices have chipped away at Micron’s business, though Micron management, which has steered the company towards twelve straight earnings beats, has downplayed the issue, expressing confidence the company can overcome the cycle. On Wednesday the company must give investors reason to fully believe that the cyclical nature of the memory chip business — the type that stores information in mobile devices and helps processors crunch data in computers and data centers —  won’t impact its long-term prospects. The company must also demonstrate signs of a turnaround by guiding in a way that suggests confidence about what investors should expect in the second half of 2019. For the quarter that ended February, the Boise, Idaho-based company is expected to earn $1.70 per share on revenue of $5.89 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $2.82 per share on revenue of $7.35 billion. For the full year, ending August, earnings are projected to be $7.36 per share, down from $11.95 per share a year ago, while full-year revenue of $24.89 billion would decline 18% year over year. The expected year-over-year decline on both the top and bottom lines have been the major reason for the stock’s punishment. But beyond the headline numbers, all eyes will be on Micron’s forecast for the current quarter and the full fiscal year. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra was optimistic about the state of DRAM prices, saying in October that the supply and demand imbalance should last only a quarter or two. Micron stock reacted favorably to those statements, climbing some 16% since the company’s last earnings report. The Street, however, will want some sign from Micron on Wednesday to support Mehrotra’s optimism that DRAM prices will, in fact, bounce back at some point this year. For Q3, which ends in May, the Street forecasts EPS of $1.26 per share on revenue of $5.42 billion. It remains to be seen whether Micron will guide to meet those estimates or do so in a way to suggest the memory cycle needs more time. From my vantage point, it seems much of the investment risk is now priced into the stock, which trades at just five times forward estimates, compared to a P/E of 18 for the S&P; 500 index, making Micron a compelling play for the next 12 to 18 months.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 20, 2019, 08:08:07 AM EDT",Micron (MU) 2nd Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""We don't want to build this in a   vacuum,"" he said. Zuckerberg likened the planned news tab to the way the company   has broken out video in its Watch tab, which is aggregating video   from a number of publishers, some of which are producing video   exclusively for the platform.   Facebook    Watch ""has started to really grow quickly,"" Zuckerberg said.   ""We've decided that there really is an opportunity to do   something like this with news as well."" Zuckerberg didn't share many additional details, and said the   company was still trying to figure out how to balance curation   with aggregation of the sources a user was already following. He   also suggested that the company was looking to give publishers   new ways to make money. ""There is a real opportunity to have   better monetization for publishers than we have today at news   feed,"" he said.makeArticleAd(); He cited Facebook's news subscription efforts as evidence that   the company was looking to support the industry financially, but   also had to admit that these efforts haven't been very impactful   yet. ""That's off to a reasonable start. There is lots more to do   there,"" he said. Facebook's commitment to double down on news comes after the   company began to de-emphasize news articles in its main news feed   to re-focus on personal connections between its users. Those   changes, instituted in early 2018, resulted in a 20% drop of news   content shown to its users,   according to numbers shared by Facebook   executives shared at the time.  Facebook   posted a video    of Zuckerberg's hourlong conversation with Doepfner Monday   morning as a first of what is supposed to be a series of talks   about the future of the internet and society. Doepfner was a bit   of a polarizing choice to kick off the series: The Springer CEO   has led the company's foray into the digital space, but has also   been a strong advocate of recent European copyright changes,   commonly known as ""Article 13,"" that have been criticized by many   as being harmful to the internet. In his conversation with Zuckerberg, Doefner celebrated the   European parliament's recent passage of those changes, likening   them to the compulsory licensing regimen the music industry has   been working with for decades, and suggesting Facebook should   adhere to similar rules. Article 13 had gotten a lot of public push-back from Google in   particular, with YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki arguing that it would   make it impossible for millions of users to upload content to her   site, or to view content posted by U.S. creators. But on Monday, Zuckerberg seemed open to embrace similar   rules. ""That's definitely something we should be thinking about   here,"" he said with regards to Article 13, while also cautioning   that ""there is a lot of details to be worked out there.""

125," Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has been a pioneer among technology giants in offering Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) on its cloud platform, Azure. The company embarked on its blockchain journey in November 2015 with its announcement to support Ethereum on Microsoft Azure. Fast forward to today, Azure supports almost all the major blockchain platforms and can deploy a wide variety of network configurations. Since its first move towards toward blockchain, Microsoft has made meaningful progress by engaging with hundreds of enterprises across sectors and industries. Here’s a look at its major partnerships over the past one year and why such collaborations are important for its overall business. With the aim to improve visibility and streamline the costly and time-consuming processes in entertainment rights and royalties, Microsoft and Ernst & Young (E&Y;) launched a blockchain solution for content rights and royalty management. The underlying network is built using the Quorum blockchain protocol and Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure and blockchain technologies. To bring digital ledger interoperability to Nasdaq Financial Framework (NFF), Nasdaq (NDAQ) and announced the integration of Nasdaq Financial Framework (NFF) with Microsoft Azure blockchain. The collaboration will work on building a blockchain powered multi-ledger strategy. Nasdaq sees immediate opportunity for blockchain “to manage the delivery, payment, and settlement of transactions that may reside on multiple blockchains with different payment mechanisms.” Worldwide, many prominent stock exchanges are looking at ways to leverage the blockchain technology to fundamentally overhaul traditional mechanisms. Continuing with its partnerships to help enterprises adopt blockchain technology, Microsoft partnered with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Together, Microsoft, R3 and TCS aim to drive scaled adoption of blockchain across industries. TCS has already identified and is developing five blockchain platforms that include, digital identity, track and trace, assets in common, asset monetization, and tokenization. One of the most recent collaborations of Microsoft is with Cargo Community Network (CCN) to launch the world’s first blockchain air cargo billing, costing and reconciliation system. Leveraging Microsoft Azure blockchain technology, CCN is set to deliver a single immutable source of information for air cargo shipment rates, shipment details and billing processes—all via blockchain with real-time updates provided by stakeholders. The use of blockchain will streamline the entire supply chain while enhancing operational efficiency for airlines, cargo agents and freight forwarders. Despite the potential that blockchain offers to varied businesses, there are multiple obstacles (such as scalability or governance) to overcome before enterprises can fully adopt the technology. Microsoft actively identifies existing technology gaps and helps organizations build durable enterprise-grade blockchain applications. In May last year, Microsoft introduced Azure Blockchain Workbench to public preview and dubbed it as “the fastest way to get started with blockchain on Azure.” Workbench makes it easy to integrate blockchain workflows with existing systems by using Microsoft Flow and Logic Apps. In November, Microsoft released the initial version of the Azure blockchain development kit which is built on Microsoft’s serverless technologies and seamlessly integrates blockchain with the best of Microsoft and third-party SaaS. The worldwide spending on blockchain solutions is rising. According to IDC estimates worldwide spending on blockchain solutions is forecasted around $2.9 billion in 2019, an increase of 88.7% from the $1.5 billion spent in 2018. It is expected to reach $12.4 billion in 2022, growing at a CAGR of 76.0% (2018-2022). While a survey by Juniper shows the enthusiasm among enterprises to adopt blockchain-driven solutions. As per the survey, 65% of companies with more than 10,000 employees were considering or actively engaging in blockchain deployment with almost 25% of companies considering deploying blockchain have moved beyond the Proof of Concept stage. The survey ranks Microsoft as the second most-preferred company to go to for blockchain deployment. The rising interest among enterprises and increased spending on blockchain solutions presents a huge opportunity for companies such as Microsoft which are focused to emerge as a preferred cloud platform in the “mobile-first, cloud-first, data-powered world.” Microsoft has the second largest market share in the cloud infrastructure market. During Q2 2019, the intelligent cloud segment recorded a revenue of $9.6 billion, an increase of 20% year-on-year. The revenue from cloud constitutes almost 30% of the company’s revenue. Overall, Microsoft is powering the blockchain trend by collaborating with enterprise clients and helping them adopt blockchain solutions using BaaS which supports its cloud-first vision.",Prableen Bajpai,"April 01, 2019, 08:47:06 AM EDT",Where Microsoft Is Making Inroads With Blockchain,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

HP    's new Reverb VR headset offers 2160 x 2160 pixels for each eye,   compared to the 2,880 x 1,600 pixels total resolution of the Vive   Pro.

The announcement of the new device coincided with the Game   Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco, but HP actually   unveiled the Reverb at its own World Partner Forum in Houston,   Tx. That choice is more than coincidental: The company is first   and foremost targeting enterprise customers with the new device,   with HP's global VR headset lead John Ludwig saying that the   company got a lot of inbound requests from companies after   releasing its first headset 2 years ago.makeArticleAd(); ""Text legibility is super important"" for corporate trainings   and other enterprise uses cases, said Ludwig. A demo given to   Variety    recently showed that the higher resolution indeed does help with   reading in VR.

HP is selling the Reverb's Pro edition to enterprise customers   for $649 starting in late April.

Omniverse has defended itself by claiming that it obtained a   far-reaching license to redistribute satellite TV programming   over the internet, but the lawsuit put the future of services   powered by the company in doubt. SiliconDust didn't immediately respond to a request for   comment Friday, but the company has made it clear to customers   that the decision to shut down Premium TV isn't affecting its   core business. ""We want to thank you for your business, and we want to assure   you that we are not done innovating,"" the company said in its   email. ""We are excited about upcoming plans for improving   the cord cutting and cord shaving experiences.""

136,"Yesterday, after months of media speculation, Uber (UBER) announced the  acquisition of Careem  for $3.1bn. The offer consisted of: The transaction unexpectedly provided a pretty interesting, albeit imperfect, last-minute transaction comp for Lyft ( LYFT  ) ahead of its IPO. Although Lyft only operates in North America and Careem operates in the Middle East, Africa, Turkey and Pakistan, user figures appear surprisingly similar. Based on the very limited information available on Careem, it appears Lyft's valuation of $20bn+ is high vs. Careem's valuation or alternatively Careem's valuation is low (to be fair, though, more than half of the offer is in notes convertible into Uber shares, which may have a lot of upside). Given the lack of financial information on Careem, I will keep this note relatively short with the goal of promoting an intellectual discussion on LYFT's valuation. Since I have not seen any reliable financial figures about Careem, this comparison will be kept to high-level user data, which come from reliable sources. Source: Lyft S-1  , Forbes  , Reuters For reference, Lyft defines 'Active Rider  ' as: We define Active Riders as all riders who take at least one     ride on our multimodal platform through the Lyft app during a     quarter. An Active Rider is identified by a unique phone     number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed     their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone     numbers during the quarter, that person would count as two     Active Riders. Illustratively, let's create a valuation metric that we define as value per user  (the thought is courtesy of SA contributor The Protagonist  ). If we do this 'user math', the results are as follows: While, this may not be surprising to many as it conceptually makes sense the average North America-based Lyft user should be valued more than the average Careem user, who likely has much less purchasing power and is spending much less in absolute terms. Some important points to note. As you can likely tell from my     previous article      , I am very focused on insurance as it relates to Lyft's     potential path to profitability. It would definitely be     interesting to see how that all works in the markets Careem     operates in, maybe the rideshare model there has an easier path     to profitability. Since we don't have that info, though, I     can't really jump to any solid conclusions. However, my gut     feeling, after talking to people from markets like Dubai and     Pakistan, is the insurance costs/liability risks in the markets     Careem operates in are not as bad as they are in North America,     but I could be wrong. Careem also has a food delivery business (     Careem     NOW      ), which may have very attractive margins and growth potential.     Lyft doesn't have this additional upside in its business. I would argue Careem's business is probably pretty difficult     to compete with/replicate because it, in some cases, is     creating/owns the actual infrastructure to make ridesharing     possible in the markets it operates in (i.e.     mapping, facilitating cash/credit card     transactions/driver payments      ,     safety features incorporating local culture      ). For example, in Pakistan, it appears they have     unintentionally created an innovative screening company that     could have additional value for other companies, such as     financial services firms. In the Middle East, Africa, Turkey, and Pakistan, car     penetration is much lower than US and the     ratio of young adults high      (i.e. this, one could argue, is a much higher growth region     than the US and provides a much larger growth runway vs. North     America rideshare). I found this     excerpt from an article      written by Careem Co-founder/CEO Mudassir Sheikha very     interesting...  From Morocco to Pakistan (what we refer to as the broader     Middle East), the region is home to 700m people. The GDP is     almost the size of Latin America, 50% bigger than India, and     40% of the region is connected to the internet with     smartphones. By most yardsticks, that's significant and     well-connected. Additionally, the region is highly under-penetrated. For     example, the number of cars per 1000 people ranges from 336 in     Saudi Arabia to 36 in Egypt to 18 in Pakistan; that's in     comparison to almost 800 in the US. Such low car penetration     means entirely different dynamics for a regional ride-hailing     platform like Careem compared to its peers in more developed     markets. We are not replacing cars, nor public transport     (little of which exists too); rather, we are literally building     a transportation system for the first time in our cities. This     difference has profound implications on both product design and     go-to-market strategies. Similar examples exist in almost every     sector where technology is helping the region leap-frog old     infrastructure. Careem provides a very interesting, albeit imperfect, transaction comp to Lyft as it appears to be very similarly-sized (at least by users). Based on what we know about Careem, Lyft's imminent listing of over $20bn should be contextualized vs. Careem's $3.1bn acquisition by Uber. From a markets/trading perspective, when Uber files, its business is going to look increasingly diversified/dominant vs. Lyft, and that could have implications for how Lyft trades in the near term and beyond. Finally, Careem was acquired by a strategic Uber and likely incorporates a premium vs. a Careem publicly listing valuation due to operational synergies Uber can achieve via Careem.

138,"Chris Helgren (Reuters) This morning, the executives at Lyft (LYFT) began their tour around the major companies of Wall Street, looking for investors in their upcoming IPO. I have, in the past, laid out a case here as to why IPOs, and high-profile IPOs in particular, can be a minefield for individual investors. Very often, the publicity creates a degree of interest that results in excessive demand, sometimes almost regardless of value at the launch, that results in an initial surge in price to unsustainable levels. It is then better to wait for the pullback from the initial highs before jumping in, but for several reasons, Lyft may be a different story. Ignoring for now what followed after these companies went public: the “jump and drop” pattern following an initial offering has held true in most well-publicized initial tech offerings, from Facebook (FB), through Twitter (TWTR) and Snap (SNAP), with a whole host in between. There are, however, two big differences with Lyft; the potential of the company and the current attitude of institutional investors. From a potential perspective, the LYFT launch is in many ways more like that of Facebook than any that has come since. Lyft, like Facebook, is the first company to go public in what is a truly disruptive industry. At the time of their IPO, there were a lot of questions about Facebook: How would they monetize their popularity? Could they prevail against a host of competitors? How could they justify such a huge valuation? People were wary of the concept after witnessing the rapid rise and even more rapid demise of MySpace, and Facebook was already in a battle for supremacy in the social media space with Twitter. What Mark Zuckerberg’s company showed in the ensuing years was that the assumptions regarding the overall popularity of social media that underlaid all of those questions were way off the mark. There turned out to be plenty of room for multiple platforms and massive demand from users. Growth, both in terms of users and revenue, was explosive. Still, the doubts were there and after reaching $45 on its first day of trading, FB fell to $17.55 over the next few months. Obviously, even after the recent problems, it was the drop, not the initial surge that was the mistake, and investors are all too aware of that. From a competitive perspective too, now is an ideal time for LYFT’s IPO. The problems that have beset their big rival Uber are being addressed and will probably fade from the public consciousness soon, but their presence now may limit, or even eliminate, the post-IPO dip that has been so typical in the past. That is why those who are saying that Lyft is overvalued at or around the proposed $62-68 offering price are missing the point. You can argue that is the case based on a normal multiple of revenue, but this is not a normal industry. The pace of acceptance of ride-sharing as a concept has been so rapid that it is hard to estimate the potential total market but, as with social media, the likelihood is that what estimates there are will turn out to be way too low. The other thing that has changed is the attitude of institutional investors to losses in a disruptive company like Lyft. Amazon (AMZN) changed the game in that regard, and it is only relatively recently that they have shown what can happen when the switch is turned on. Every trade or investment involves a risk/reward calculation and AMZN’s recent profitability has skewed the reward side of that equation to such an extent that in some cases big losses are no longer as scary as they were just a few years ago. A full analysis of the value of the LYFT stock at issuance is, of course, impossible right now as we don’t know what the offering price will be. What we can do though, even at this stage, is assess the potential for long-term growth and the likely attitude of the market to the stock. On both of those fronts, LYFT looks at this early stage to be a winner. If you have an opportunity to participate at the offer price, therefore, it makes sense to do so, but unlike in several recent cases, doing that in order to bank a quick profit may not be the best strategy.",Martin Tillier,"March 18, 2019, 01:13:03 PM EDT",A Preview of the Lyft (LYFT) IPO,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
139,"Lucas Jackson for Reuters Maybe it’s just the effects of recency bias, but I honestly cannot remember an IPO as eagerly awaited nor as potentially impactful as Lyft (LYFT)’s today, and I am old enough to remember when companies like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) went public. All of those were interesting, and all well-hyped, but none of them seemed to have the broader implications that are being attached to LYFT’s debut on the Nasdaq. The fact is though, that for most of us, Lyft’s IPO and the trading in its immediate aftermath will be a spectator sport, so how does it affect the average retail investor? The irony here is that, unlike say Google and Facebook, Lyft is not even the market leader in the relatively young industry in which it operates. What it is though, is the first ride-sharing company, or, more prosaically, modern taxi company, to offer shares to the public. Uber is still waiting in the wings. More importantly still, Lyft is the first runner in what some wag has dubbed a “stampede of unicorns.” Unicorns, in this context, are companies that have achieved rapid growth and massive public awareness in a fairly short time but have remained in private hands. It was a term originally used because such things were very rare, but the fact that there a whole host of them stampeding over the metaphorical SEC hill somewhat belies that term now. Still, it is a lot easier to use the accepted collective pronoun than to list Uber, Pinterest, Airbnb, WeWork et al each time, so “unicorns” it is. Whatever you want to call them, though, they are a fascinating breed. As the first to actually list, Lyft is also the first where we can get a glimpse of the company’s financials. To some people, those numbers are what give this IPO an almost mystical feel. They have waited a long time to IPO, which in the past may have been because a company felt that it needed to show the ability to turn a profit before asking for investors’ money. These unicorns, however, have no such modesty. Lyft’s cash burn is around $1 billion a year at this point (yes, billion, with a “b”) and is forecast to increase substantially in the near future. With a unicorn IPO, though, profit is not the point. What matters are sales and growth, and at $8 billion a year and increasing exponentially, that is extremely healthy. What the performance of the stock today and over the next week or so will tell us is whether or not investors are prepared to pay a hefty price for that growth, as we have been told they are. There are a few reasons to believe they will. Private equity firms have been happy to do that for a while, and the biggest complaint from most institutional money has not been that valuations are getting too high, but that they have been denied the chance to bid them up even further. The second is that, as scary as the projected losses sound to the more traditional-minded investor, they are easily justifiable. As the industry matures, particularly in the direction of driverless vehicles, Uber will not be Lyft’s only big rival. Every major tech company out there has been at least dabbling in the autonomous vehicle space, with Google leading the way among them. If you are to take on Google and their $109 billion stash of cash at anything, you need to commit to a lot of spending. The numbers may look a bit scary but given the circumstances and the potential rewards of being a leader in the space, they are fully justified. There is, then, every reason to believe that Lyft’s IPO will be a roaring success. As strange as it may seem to most retail investors that the big money is chasing shares in a company that has never made a dime and is looking forward to even bigger losses, they should be cheering the IPO on. This is a delicate time for the market as a whole. The recent crash in Treasury yields has led to an inverted yield curve, a pattern that has preceded most recessions and has been a reliable indicator in the past. The global economy is looking weak, with Brexit an unholy mess and Chinese growth slowing. Even in the relatively strong U.S. economy, things are not what they seemed a few months ago. Q4 GDP was revised down to a point where the 3% growth target for 2018 was missed and, while the 2.5-3% growth that we have had on and off for 10 years is not bad, the market had been expecting more. At this point, if investors show enough confidence in the future to make the LYFT launch a success, we will all be able to breathe a little easier. It may seem crazy to say it is a good sign that stock in a company that isn’t a leader in its own market, and which is losing cash hand over fist, will be in demand, but that is really the case. It would show a long-term confidence that would be welcome right now. In that way, the LYFT IPO matters to us all. Even if it is not in our nature to go unicorn hunting, markets rise on confidence, and that will receive a much-needed boost if LYFT trades solidly above the $72 offering price today.",Martin Tillier,"March 29, 2019, 09:27:10 AM EDT",What Lyft's IPO Means For The Typical Investor,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
140,"Shutterstock photo With advancements in medicine, the prevention of epidemics, and better nutrition, the rise of the human population has become pronounced. The same cannot be said for animals. Humans continue to exert pressure not just on natural resources but also on wildlife. In fact, the figures in the population of wildlife portray a grim picture. Illicit activities such as poaching and wildlife trafficking are pushing endangered species closer to extinction. While the efforts made by international organizations and government authorities are on, a lot more needs to be done before it’s too late. Here’s how advanced technology is being leveraged to combat such illegal activities. The problem is grave An estimate in the 2018 Living Planet Report by the WWF International suggests that the global population of vertebrate animals has fallen by almost 60% since 1970 (1970-2014). At the London 2018 Illegal Wildlife Trade conference, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt shared some dismal numbers: “Forty years ago, Africa had about 1.3 million elephants. Today, the figure is down by two thirds to 415,000. In Asia, the population of wild tigers has dropped by 95% since 1900.” Different species of wildlife are poached for different reasons—elephants for ivory, rhinoceros for horns, tigers and leopards for skin, and iguanas are caught for the pet trade, among others. The demand for ivory, which is seen as a symbol of status and wealth, continues to remain high, a primary factor leading to devastating poaching across regions such as Africa. It is estimated that at least 33,000 elephants are killed each year for their tusks in the African continent alone. Not just elephants -- rhino poaching rose by 7,700% in South Africa during 2007 to 2013. By one estimate, illegal wildlife trafficking is the fourth most profitable crime in the world, after drugs, humans, and arms, generating as much as $23 billion. A solution in technology may help to reduce the menace of poaching By using deep network algorithms, it is possible to detect human and vehicle presence with high degree of accuracy to ‘sound alerts.’ One such device is RESOLVE’s TrailGuard AI camera which is powered by Intel’s (INTC) tiny yet powerful Intel Movidius Myriad2 VPU, which delivers visual intelligence to the camera itself, resulting in several important benefits. The AI technology is being used to detect poachers entering Africa’s wildlife reserves and alert park rangers in near real-time so poachers can be stopped before killing endangered animals. TrailGuard AI will be deployed in 100 reserves in Africa throughout 2019, starting with Serengeti and Garamba in partnership with the National Geographic Society and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. There are plans to expand to Southeast Asia and South America. The authorities at the 37,000 hectares Welgevonden Game Reserve in South Africa are collaborating with IBM (IBM) to harness cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive analytics technologies to combat the poaching of endangered rhinos. Collars with embedded sensors that are placed on typical preyed-upon animals, including zebra, wildebeest, eland and impala, leaving out the rhinos. The information via sensors related to location, movement pattern, direction and average speed of travel of these animals is monitored and studied. The data collected is being used to create algorithms, built on the prey-animals’ response to perceived threats to making poaching predictable, and thus preventable. Meanwhile Microsoft (MSFT) with its AI for Earth initiative has been giving grants to projects that use artificial intelligence for building a sustainable future. Traditionally, analysts spend hours and hours studying thousands of images taken from satellites, drones or camera traps in the wild to decipher range, populations, and behaviors of animals otherwise rarely seen by humans. It is laborious work. This is one area where advanced technologies such as deep learning is making a difference. A Microsoft AI solution is accelerating the process with a machine learning model that can identify snow leopards and automatically classify hundreds of thousands of photos in a matter of minutes. The Elephant Listening Project and Wild Me are some other Microsoft backed AI projects for wildlife conservation. In response to the aggressive poaching activities in Africa, Vulcan, Inc. developed EarthRanger. Vulcan, Inc. describes itself as the engine behind philanthropist and Microsoft cofounder Paul G. Allen's network of organizations and initiatives. Vulcan’s EarthRanger is a software platform that collects information on activity in a protected area using digital radios, animal collars and vehicle tracking. All such information was previously housed on separate devices creating disconnects. EarthRanger integrates it all into a single one-stop data hub. The platform also adds ranger observations such as snare traps, animal carcasses and footsteps. One single stop for all data enables quicker analysis and proactively intercepts poaching activity. The EarthRanger is deployed in a multiple location across Africa. The illicit wildlife trade is a primary reason that many species are endangered, and these activities are a part of a bigger network These crimes are orchestrated by sophisticated criminal networks that smuggle guns, people, and drugs. While a lot needs to be done to curb these heinous crimes, the deployment of advanced technologies is a positive step forward.",Prableen Bajpai,"March 18, 2019, 10:36:27 AM EDT","How Advanced Technology Can Help Save Wildlife, And The Companies Behind Them",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

142,"Shutterstock photo What are you looking for in an investment? How about companies that are trying to disrupt the market, potentially generating substantial rewards if they get it right? Here we take a closer look at three top-rated tech stocks primed to outperform in the coming months. By using TipRanks’ data we can also dive in to the latest recommendations from best-performing analysts to gain their investing insights into these top 3 stock picks. AutoDesk, Inc. (ADSK – Research Report) In essence, AutoDesk makes products for people who make things. Its groundbreaking technology enables everyone from architects to engineers to create digital prototypes. And by optimizing plans from early in the process customers can save both time and money. Indeed, ADSK already operates as an industry-standard, must-have technology in nearly every industry it operates in. However change is afoot. For the last two years, the company has been steadily shifting its business model, moving from the sale and maintenance of software packages and installations to a SaaS mode, selling subscriptions to cloud-based products. The move has been successful; subscription revenues now count for $2.2 billion, 83% of the $2.57 billion annual total. In terms of customer numbers, Autodesk has 4 million subscribers of whom 3.2 million are subscription-based. At current growth rates, AutoDesk could double its subscription rate within three years. What’s more, the company is at the cusp of a major opportunity in the construction industry. According to estimates, the rapidly-growing construction software market could reach $10 billion market by 2020. So it’s no surprise that Autodesk has worked hard to boost its construction offering recently. ADSK snapped up construction software platform BuildingConnected for $275 million back in December, supplementing its previous $875 million purchase for PlanGrid the previous month. As CEO Andrew Anagnost explained: “We are investing in digitizing and automating construction workflows. Autodesk’s goal is to connect construction processes across design, build and operations.” Gladly, the deals received the thumbs up from the Street. Most notably, five-star Oppenheimer analyst Koji Ikeda (Track Record & Ratings) writes: “We believe the business is well positioned in a large but lightly penetrated construction industry that is yearning for next-generation technologies, like Autodesk's, to help digitize the industry, which should act as a pillar for Autodesk's next leg of growth beyond FY2020.” He has a buy rating on the stock, and recently ramped up the price target from $160 to $190 (24% upside potential). Apple, Inc. (AAPL – Research Report) Apple has already demonstrated that its willing to shake things up this year with its much-hyped press event on March 25. The company’s “It’s Show Time” special event ushered in a new wave of monetization opportunities. It also provided users with even more reasons to inhabit Planet Apple in the coming years- all while reducing Apple’s much-slated iPhone dependency. The only physical product announced at the event was a titanium credit card, but there was still plenty for investors to get excited about. Alongside the new reward card, Apple revealed new media subscription services including the $9.99/ month Apple News Plus (magazine), Apple Arcade (mobile game), and Apple TV Plus (TV and movie streaming). In terms of timelines, Apple News Plus is immediately available while other services will launch later in 2019. “Apple is offering more user-friendly subscription services to its installed base (largely in North America). We see clear benefits and differentiating features that may appeal to niche audiences” commented five-star Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz (Track Record & Ratings). However, as Uerkwitz points out, there is still much we need to know. Most critically, the price of Apple TV remains one of the biggest unanswered questions- and ultimately could make or break the product in the face of so many rival streaming services. Not that this has dimmed the enthusiasm of Monness analyst Brian White (Track Record & Ratings). He writes in his post-event report of the new TV offering- dubbed the Netflix killer- “we believe this new service lays the foundation for a significant revenue stream for Apple over the next decade and provides the company with a blank canvas to experiment with original content.” CarGurus Inc (CARG – Research Report) CarGurus’ mission is to be the world’s most trusted and transparent auto marketplace. It currently offers consumers the largest used cars inventory (5.4MM units), with an active network of over 40,000 US dealers. So far the company is excelling thanks to its savvy consumer focus. Just one example, CARG’s monthly audience size are over 2x competing marketplaces, with traffic continuing to see healthy growth. “CARG’s differentiated, consumer-centric marketplace is enabling it to quickly grow site traffic while rival platforms seem constrained in their ability to respond/follow” cheers five-star SunTrust Robinson analyst Naved Khan (Track Record & Ratings). The analyst has a $52 price target- suggesting shares have 38% upside potential to run in the coming months. And recent investor meetings have only served to drive more positive attention from the Street. On March 26, DA Davidson analyst Tom White ""enthusiastically"" affirmed his Buy rating and $54 price target. From current levels that indicates upside potential of over 40%. Management is confident of having ""the wind at its back in virtually all elements of its business in 2018"" and fully expects 2019 momentum to continue. White believes CarGurus can generate significant audience/connections growth thanks to a ""growing contribution from upselling"" newer products. Just a handful of these innovations include SEM, Dealer Display, Delivery, enhanced listings, and Audience Re-targeting. At the same time, the analyst anticipates that CarGurus delivery offerings for dealers should grow increasing popular with paying customers. This review wouldn’t be complete without mentioning a recent upgrade from Goldman Sachs. Analyst Daniel Powell upgraded CarGurus to buy after assuming coverage from Heath Terry. Citing traffic growth and marketing efficiency, Powell also boosted the firm’s price target from $43 to $48.

Ahead of a Tuesday press event, Google has been hinting that   its video game plans include a hardware component. Most notably,   the company   launched a placeholder page    on the Google Store, which it uses to sell its own phones, smart   speakers, and streaming devices.

On the surface, the patent seems to be all about remote media   control, similar to the way Chromecast works, with references to   ""a simple video decoding device"" without ""physical interfaces for   accepting human input."" But dig into the details, and take a look   at the illustrations, and it quickly becomes clear that this is   all about gaming. From the patent: ""In one non-limiting example, a mobile device can establish a   streaming session in a cloud-based gaming environment. (…) In   some implementations, a user can access streaming media (e.g., an   online game, video, application, etc.) on her display device   (e.g., a television) through a media player connected to the   display device and the Internet. (…) Once the session is   established, the user may put away her mobile device and pick up   the game controller (paired/connected to her mobile device) and   begin playing the game over the streaming media session."" In other words: Users may pick and launch a cloud-based game   from their phone, cast it to their TV, and then use a game   controller to play it. The idea that Google would use Chromecast to launch its gaming   service is not new.

Tha   t report    indicated that development eventually shifted to a dedicated   video game console, but a number of clues suggest that there is   still some connection to Chromecast.  9to5Google discovered in September    that Google developers had referenced ""Yeti folks"" in comments on   an open source component of Chromecast's code, suggesting that   the team working on Google's gaming service was pushing for   low-latency video streaming on Google's TV dongle. But the link appears even deeper.   Variety    discovered this week that the gaming service is already   referenced in the code running on Google's Chromecast.

Sony Pictures Television    chief digital officer Eric Berger, who had been running   Crackle    , is expected to leave the company once the deal closes. In an exclusive interview with   Variety    , Sony Pictures Television chairman Mike Hopkins, and CSS   Entertainment chairman and CEO Bill Rouhana both described the   partnership as a way to better take advantage of the opportunity   of ad-supported video. ""We look at the AVOD [ad-supported   video-on-demand] market as being ripe for innovation,"" Hopkins   said.makeArticleAd(); ""Roughly 50% of the VOD (market) revenue will come from   advertising,"" Rouhana said. Both he and Hopkins argued that   ad-supported video services needed to consolidate to attract more   money from big brands. ""It doesn't make a lot of sense for there   to be hundreds of AVOD networks,"" Rouhana said. Sony will contribute Crackle's U.S. brand, its user base, and   its advertising business to the joint venture. Sony   Entertainment's New Media Services will provide the back-end tech   for the joint venture, and Sony Pictures Television is also   licensing movies and TV shows from the Sony Pictures catalog to   Crackle Plus. CSS Entertainment will contribute its own ad-supported video   services Popcornflix, Truli, Popcornflix Kids, Popcornflix   Comedy, Frightpix, and Espanolflix, as well as the subscription   video services company Pivotshare. Rouhana said Popcornflix and   Crackle would remain unchanged for the time being, but that there   would likely be some differentiation between the two services   over time. Sony acquired Crackle all the way back in 2006, when the   service was still known as Grouper. In the following years, it   built out Crackle as an ad-supported video service, making use of   both Sony's catalog of movies and TV shows, as well as investing   in original content. One of the best-known shows on Crackle was   Jerry Seinfeld's web series ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,""   which played on the service for nine seasons before moving to   Netflix. However, there have been signs for some time that Sony wanted   to exit the business. The   company laid off    some Crackle staffers last year, and it has   closed both Crackle's Canada    and   Latin America businesses    over the past nine months. ""It wasn't our core business,"" Hopkins admitted. ""It wasn't   our core skill set."" Going forward, Sony will focus more on its   core competencies - namely the production and distribution of   content, he said. So why not sell Crackle outright? The logic for the deal   ultimately comes down to the fact that it allows Sony to profit   from any upside without having to sink more money into the video   service. Rouhana said he didn't expect Crackle Plus to need any   further cash infusions. ""We will run this as a profitable   business,"" he said.  Sony began to look at strategic alternatives for   Crackle last summer    , and at the time retained investment bank Moelis & Co.,   which ultimately also represented the company in this deal.   Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. served as the adviser to CSS   Entertainment. Ad-supported video has gotten a lot of attention in recent   months. In January, Viacom plunked down $340 million to   acquire AVOD startup Pluto    .

Even with big competitors, Crackle Plus will aim to be a major   player in the AVOD space, according to the two executives.

148,"Getty images With the increasing number of new investment management technologies coming into the asset management industry, it’s not just the new technology that deserves the scrutiny but specifically how it is being fused into the investment process.  It’s both interesting and revelatory to see how an innovation works its way into incumbent status-quo thinking and current ways of doing things. With artificial intelligence (AI), it may also be disrupting other quant strategies in its wake, like factor investing to name one. Mondrian Investment Partners is an international value-oriented investment manager based in London that has been launching new products and expanding their presence in the US. One of these new funds, which caught our eye, is the Rothko Emerging Markets Equity Fund (RKEMX) - an artificial intelligence-based emerging markets equity mutual fund. Especially interesting is the way their investment division - Rothko Investment Strategies also based in London - is applying AI, as they characterize it, as a defensive value driven tool. Their unique application in emerging markets and in the quant world in general warrants greater inquiry and exploration. The Institute for Innovation Development decided to reach out to Dan Philps, Head of Investment Strategies at Rothko to learn more. Come, let’s explore this together... Hortz:How did you come up with the idea for your AI approach for your Fund? Philps: Research into the methodology underlying Rothko began in 2007 and was the brainchild of Mondrian's Executive Chairman (and founding CEO), David Tilles. The idea was developed levering off the organization’s vast experience of identifying value opportunities in global equity markets and made possible by the recent explosion of high quality data and computing power. The aim of the research was to systematically replicate the best of human decision making, encapsulating tried and true value investment rationales centered on defensiveness and future income generation with an AI type of approach. We believe AI offers another way to drive fundamental investing but in an objective way. Hortz:How did you actually build your AI program? What was involved and can you share your experience in developing it? Philps: It was a long journey to develop Rothko. David Tilles’ vast experience as founding CIO of a successful fundamental shop and my twenty years of quantitative investing and AI research was a prerequisite. Our starting point was to define a solid, underlying philosophy - income orientation and value investing. We then examined how a best of breed, human-driven manager achieved defensive returns and strong outperformance and we identified two key points that helped us design Rothko’s investment strategies. Firstly, we found that consistently good, human stock selectors tended to use a systematic fundamental approach to identify opportunities, rather like Warren Buffett’s approach. Secondly, we found that people generally made poor portfolio managers, suffering from behavioral biases, such as anchoring where stocks are held too long. This has led us to use AI to drive a rules based stock selection approach and use an AI approach to learn when to trade. It is an approach that aims to be both consistent and objective. We believe the results have been impressive. Hortz: How does the AI program learn and can you moderate or adjust its learning? Philps: Rothko learns steadily through time and has memories of the shape of crises and opportunities of the past to guide future decision making. My experienced portfolio management team monitors portfolios in real time but we have rarely had to override the approach. This is mainly because Rothko only needs to learn information it does not already know and because the system is already very powerful, that means the learning process tends to be slow and steady. Hortz: What specifically has your AI “learned” so far about shaping a systematic value approach to international and emerging market equities? Philps: Rothko has learned many things; most importantly how return opportunities can be exploited in international equity markets. We believe our performance speaks for itself on this. We have learned many things from Rothko too, such as the importance of the way a company treats its shareholders. This is important to Rothko’s stock selection, especially in Emerging Markets. One piece of knowledge that particularly concerns us is the indirect impact of the multi trillion dollar shift into factor investing. On closer inspection we believe the factor trades of traditional quants have become dangerously crowded and this risks a repeat of 2007’s “quant quake”. It is important to understand that Rothko does not use factors (after Fama and French) or traditional quant tools. Hortz:How can applying AI to the investment decision process potentially add high alpha or excess return relative to benchmarks? Philps: A well-conceived AI approach can, we believe, exceed the limitations of both human driven stock selectors and traditional quants. Firstly, humans are hard wired to think in 3 dimensions, which means there is a cognitive speed limit when weighing up the many dimensions in which a company can succeed or fail. In contrast AI can consider many, many dimensions at the same time. AI can also be designed to scale across vast and inefficient stock universes, aiming to extract bottom-up driven alpha. Traditional quants tend to drive returns using weightings to traditional factors, after Fama and French. These factors, such as Value, Growth, MinVol, Momentum, can be accessed inexpensively through ETFs these days. For us, AI is about fundamentals and bottom-up driven returns, alpha, which sets an AI approach apart from traditional quants. Hortz:How is your fund unique in its application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to current standards of fundamentally driven value investing across non-U.S. equity markets? Philps: Actually, our AI methodology has commonalities with a human-driven, active, fundamental approach. However, we believe we do not suffer from classic human behavioral pitfalls, subjective judgments, and inconsistent decision making. Additionally, Rothko’s AI can retain more information about the world to inform decisions. Our strategy can integrate a myriad of perspectives into each investment decision through different rules or models. Each one of these perspectives is used in our AI’s stock selection decisions. Hortz: Some commentators, such as Research Affiliates, imply that AI is dangerous when applied to investing. Is there any truth in this? Philps: We firmly believe that naively throwing machine learning - which is a more mechanical subset of AI - at an investment strategy is a recipe for disaster. Investment should always come before technology and, for us, an AI should be founded on investment rationales that a successful human stock selector would believe in. There have certainly been more thought pieces from traditional quants about the dangers of investments driven by AI but this is notably correlated with the level of disruption AI threatens to old quant businesses and should, in our view, be taken with a large pinch of salt. Hortz: How exactly can AI avoid, as you have mentioned, the shortcomings of factor models? Philps: Rothko’s AI investment strategy is very different from traditional quant investors that almost universally rely on ‘factors’ as mentioned. The vast majority of traditional quants generally seek to forecast expected returns or tilt exposures towards factors. We believe factor models offer shallow insights, viewing the world through a simplified, linear-constrained lens. We also note that some traditional quants are blurring the lines between their traditional approaches and AI by employing datamining, such as news sentiment scoring. We do not believe in this approach and think it amounts to window dressing. Again, factor strategies have also witnessed significant growth where we see indications of crowded factor trades. Investors are potentially exposed should there be a reversal factor sentiment. A Quant Quake 2 perhaps? Rothko’s AI maintains a low correlation to factors and a relatively high active share to style-factor indices, drawing similarities to a good, active fundamental approach. We think an AI successfully applied to investing combines the most appropriate aspects of data-driven modeling techniques with guiding human-like rationales. Hortz: How do you keep developing your AI technology and its applications? Where is your R&D; pointing to next? Philps: Our research continues to search for deeper inferences, guided by the fundamental rationales of value and income. There are a number of threads to this and one we can discuss is our interest in the cutting edge AI research area called Continual Learning. This is where machines accumulate knowledge over time and then learn how to apply that knowledge to make better decisions in the future. I was invited to present some of our research to the world’s leading AI research conference in December 2018 (NeurIPS). Hortz: Can you provide some recommendations and share your experience to advisors on how to look at and apply AI in portfolio management and how best to use it in their client portfolios? Philps: Whether RIAs are applying AI or selecting an AI tool or manager, they need to have two words at the forefront of their minds: expectations and interpretability. These are the two watch words for reviewing an AI approach in our view.  Investors should have crystal clear expectations of an AI. In Rothko’s case investors can generally expect value attributes, defensiveness and a material proportion of returns coming from the dividend component. Interpretability is critical too. An AI approach should be human readable, not a black box. In Rothko’s case every stock we hold we can talk to in terms of that stock’s fundamentals, valuations, levels of shareholder value and more. Equally we can tell you why Rothko does not hold a particular stock in the same terms.

Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Thursday. Underwater Photography : Apple has filed a patent that is connected to taking underwater photos , reports AppleInsider . The patent from AAPL explains how it could use sensors to detect when a photo is being taken below water. This would allow it to use special effects in an effort to make the image look better. This is still just a patent, which means it may never see actual implementation. However, it's neat to think about. iOS 12.3 Public Beta : The first public beta for iOS 12.3 is now available for downloa d, reports MacRumors . This new public beta comes out one day after the release of the first iOS 12.3 developer beta. It gives users a chance to try out new features coming to the company's mobile devices before the official launch. This includes the new Apple TV+ app. The new app was first shown off by the tech company at its March 25 event. Apple News+ : One developer is crying foul over the new News+ app , reports 9to5Mac . The developer claims that the tech company is breaking its own rules for the App Store with this app. He says this has to do with how free trials work and showing users what they have to pay after the trial ends. This developer is Dave DeLong, who previously worked for AAPL for seven years. The post Thursday Apple Rumors: Apple May Make Underwater Photography Easier appeared first on InvestorPlace .

152,"iStock photo It is a tough time for social media. Around the world, people are becoming increasingly aware of the downside of user-created content and blaming the platforms for what is posted there. There is a big-picture philosophical debate to be had there, but it will have to be conducted with the knowledge that the genie is out of the bottle. Social media as a method of communication and news dissemination is not going away, and the big players in the industry are starting to make changes to their platforms to increase accountability and promote accuracy. In addition, though, they are also becoming savvier about increasing engagement. The latest change to Twitter (TWTR)’s platform is a case in point. They are now allowing users of their app to simply swipe to access their phone’s camera to facilitate the posting of pictures and video. To some, that no doubt looks like a belated response to the growth of Instagram and other image-related platforms, but it is being done from a position of strength and addresses something that has been a problem for Twitter in the past: monetization. It is impossible to deny Twitter’s place in society. A huge percentage of news stories now mention Twitter. It is the preferred communication method of everybody from sports stars and journalists to the President of the United States. Since its early days, however, Twitter has faced an inherent contradiction: Its character limit and rapid-fire style mitigates against watching and reacting to advertising. Increased video content will go some way toward solving that problem. We have become accustomed to ads at the beginning of online video content and increasingly accepting of them as a price to pay for access to “free” content. Video advertising is already important to the company, accounting for over half their revenue last year, so anything that increases video content has to be a good thing for their bottom line. In its last earnings release and subsequent conference call, Twitter seemed to be positioning itself for this move. They announced a move away from the usual Monthly Active User (MAU) metric and to a new one that they created, monetizable Daily Active Users (mDAUs). This addresses a problem with the old metric; popularity is not necessarily related to profitability. By counting users who can be exposed to advertising, Twitter is confronting that head on and the switch is an indication of a new-found confidence in their ability to excel in that area.  Even so, the stock dropped significantly after those earnings, largely due to a disappointing revenue forecast, and has stayed at those lower levels as the broader market recovered this year. That is hardly surprising as analysts will have adjusted their expectations accordingly, but now that all that is baked in, the future for the stock looks good. The trailing and forward P/Es of around 20 and 30 respectively don’t scream value but, given how Twitter only began focusing on monetization relatively recently, growth, even in a difficult environment for social media, is a reasonable expectation. That is why the stock’s PEG ratio, which factors that in, is at a very attractive 0.82 (a reading below 1 is considered positive for a stock). For a long time, Twitter focused on user growth and becoming a fixture of modern life above all else, and many, including me I will admit, questioned that at a time when Facebook (FB) and others were monetizing like crazy. Now though, with the benefit of experience in what users find acceptable advertising, they are tweaking their product accordingly and significant gains in the stock look likely as a result.",Martin Tillier,"March 15, 2019, 11:27:53 AM EDT","In Difficult Environment For Social Media, Twitter (TWTR) Still Looks Like A Buy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

155,"Milos Muller for Getty Earth’s temperature has risen drastically in the last few decades with the years 2014-2018 representing the five hottest years globally. This is a cause of grave concern. The climate warming emissions are causing havoc which is costing us dearly. 2018 alone saw 14 weather and climate related disasters that resulted in 247 known fatalities, and their total costs were estimated to be about $91 billion. In the backdrop of pressing issues of climate change and environmental concerns, renewables have emerged as a ray of hope. The segment of renewable energy has garnered support from governments, corporates and investors. Here’s a look at some of investing opportunities in the renewable energy space. Renewable Energy For ages, fossil fuels have been our primary source of energy, playing a very significant role in industrialization and advancement of countries worldwide. On the flip side, they have added to pollution and toxins to all components of the environment. Despite the ill-effects of its usage, and rising awareness, it has not been easy to move away from fossil fuels towards alternative sources given the deep penetration levels that they have in our day-to-day lives. However, that process has begun. The concerns about climate change brought countries across the globe together to sign the Paris Agreement in December 2015. Not just governments but even end users and corporates are showing commitment towards the cause. A recent survey by Deloitte reveals how consumers see renewable energy; 53% of all residential survey respondents indicated that it is very important to them that part of their electricity supply comes from renewable sources while about 48% of business respondents are working to procure more electricity from renewable sources. Last year, MidAmerican Energy Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway (BKS-A, BKS-B) Energy announced that it was on its way to source 100% of its customers electricity needs from renewable energy by 2020. AWS (AMZN) has been working achieve its goal of 100% renewable energy usage for its global infrastructure footprint. By January 2018, AWS achieved 50% renewable energy usage. Last year, Apple (AAPL) announced that it achieved 100% clean energy globally for its retail stores, offices, data centers and co-located facilities in 43 countries. Likewise, giants such as Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been promoting cleaner energy for a greener future. The demand for renewables is showing an uptrend. The IEA Renewables 2018 report estimates that renewables will continue their expansion in the next five years, covering 40% of global energy consumption growth. It is projected that renewables will account for almost a third of total world electricity generation in 2023. During 2018, global clean energy investment totaled $332.1 billion in 2018 according to a report by BloombergNEF with China and the U.S. among the top nations investing in green energy. Investing Opportunities Here are the top exchange traded funds which provide a convenient, and efficient route to companies operating in the renewable energy space. Launched in 2008, Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) tracks the MAC Global Solar Energy Index and offers an opportunity to invest in companies in the solar energy industry across seven countries.

156,"Shutterstock photo Deepak Jain, Co-Founder and CEO, Swych Blockchain Labs “I need the perfect gift for her!” We’ve all yearned to come up with an awesome gift for an upcoming anniversary or birthday that our loved one would love, fits her taste perfectly, she doesn’t have it already, and it won’t gather dust in a drawer somewhere. Perhaps she would like that sweater she is eyeing, but can I pick the perfect color or size? Or maybe she would like last season’s hot book, but has she already read it? The gift card is a great option but, like any millennial, she hates receiving plastic cards. How often has she received one for a shop with no outlets nearby, for a store that sells clothes she hates, or for a restaurant whose food she finds inedible! Since gift cards represent roughly $130 billion of sales a year, chances are this happens in every household. Could a misunderstood technology, blockchain, solve this perennial problem? Blockchain is a young technology, but it’s already been employed or considered for a wide variety of uses. This “distributed ledger technology” uses computer networks to render information verifiable, unfalsifiable, and immutable. Because all the points of the network must agree about the system’s data, there’s no single point of failure at which a bad actor may introduce fraudulent information. This resistance to manipulation makes blockchain ideal for transferring value between different states. How does this apply to the gift card market? Like VHS tapes, CDs, DVDs, MP3 players, alarm clocks, and boarding passes before, plastic gift cards are poised to be relegated to history with a smarter, faster, theft/fraud-resistant, and more personal digital reincarnation. Some current limitations imposed on card use may serve to protect users—their gift is theirs, and shouldn’t be stolen by an anonymous hacker hundreds or thousands of miles away—yet the rules governing redemption still frustrate and disappoint. A blockchain makes fraud functionally impossible and renders such onerous rules unnecessary. Suppose you have a globetrotting friend or family member overseas and you’d like to send them something personal. Suppose further you’ve forgotten their birthday and are only reminded when you see a social media alert. You could send them money, but in addition to being impersonal, most conventional wire services include delays between sending and receiving a payment. This even applies to direct deposit, and, besides, how many friends’ foreign bank account numbers do you know? Sending physical gifts or even plastic gift cards across the border is not an ideal solution because of shipping costs, potential delays, and the dreaded risk of the gift not arriving on time! A digital solution though, now that is the perfect answer. Gift cards are essentially methods of value transfer, but they’re safer than cash. Because they can only be used at the intended retailer, it becomes very difficult for money launderers to take advantage. A digital solution on blockchain can make the gift card even safer. With smart ways to identify both the sender and the recipient as they interact with the system through mobile apps or websites, we can weed out hackers and fraudsters. By tracking and analyzing each transaction on the blockchain, it becomes possible to identify possible misuse and install countermeasures. Being able to reconcile every dollar on the blockchain through automatic settlements can reduce costs and delays. In cases like this, blockchain makes the difficult easy and the impossible possible. Would the users of a blockchain gift program need to understand the technology? The concepts underlying blockchain, involving as they do sophisticated mathematics and computer science, can be difficult to explain, and this complexity often makes blockchain projects daunting. Thankfully, using a gifting program would require no special knowledge. Just as you can navigate the web without understanding HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), you could send, transfer, and transform gifts without once hearing the phrase “blockchain.” There are few worse things than being thought ungrateful: You wouldn’t want your loving aunt to know that her conception of your gift taste is off. Though blockchain might allow a convenient switch, there’s nothing in a blockchain transaction that would alert the gift-giver that their recipient has transformed their gift to one retailer into credit to spend at another retailer they preferred. So rest assured: Your heartfelt thank-you note to your aunt would be honest. Gift card redemption could represent one of the first mainstream and consumer-accessible implementations of the blockchain. The thought behind the gift will continue to count, but the days of plastic gift cards and dissatisfied recipients will be passed. That will be a day to celebrate.",Guest Contributors,"March 14, 2019, 03:49:27 PM EDT",Could Digital Gifting Be The First Mainstream Consumer Use Case For Blockchain?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

158,"Shutterstock photo BlackBerry (BB) is set to report fourth quarter earnings results before the opening bell Friday. And Wall Street is eager to see the extent to which the Canadian tech giant can monetize its transition towards a security software vendor. On the heels of the company’s deal with NATO for its encrypted voice technology, CEO John Chen made it clear that security is the essence of BlackBerry’s long-term growth. The company believes it has an enormous opportunity to service customers in need of device security as the number of connected devices grow over the next several years, especially given the rate at which cyberattacks on mobile and traditional devices have grown recently. To that end, the company’s announced acquisition of Cylance, an AI (Artificial Intelligence) software company specializing in security products, bodes well. This all-cash $1.4 billion deal could allow BlackBerry, which still has a long way to go to earn Wall Street’s trust, to become more relevant as a software security vendor. It will also help expand the company’s QNX unit, which makes software for next-generation autonomous cars. BlackBerry, which has conceded the mobile hardware market to Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (SSNLF) however, must do more to convince a skeptical investor base there’s money to be made in security and figure out a way to get revenue growing again. The company’s shares have fallen more than 32% over the past year, including a sharp decline immediately following its Q3 results in December, which then pushed BB stock to a 30-month low of $6.57. For the quarter that ended February, analysts expect BlackBerry to earn 6 cent per share on revenue of $241.66 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 5 cents per share on revenue of $239 million. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 21% year over year 17 cents per share, while full-year revenue of $901 million would decline 6.8% year over year. The company’s revenues have been in a steady decline since its 2011 fiscal year. While third quarter revenue of $228 million easily topped the Street estimate by more than $14 million, it still reflected a 3% decline from the previous year. On the bright side, the company posted record high adjusted total software and services revenue of $219M, marking a 10% year-over-year increase. On Friday Wall Street will want to see this trend continue. What’s more, as I noted above, the company’s government business bodes well for sustained revenue growth, particularly from its QNX operating system. Here, again, the management must guide for fiscal 2019 in a way that suggests optimism about the impact of these contract wins. It remains to be seen how these deals and the company’s M&A; boost BlackBerry’s top- and bottom lines over the next couple of years. How it executes will determine how much premium BB stock deserves over the next 12 to 18 months.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 28, 2019, 08:25:28 AM EDT",BlackBerry (BB) 4th Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

160,"maybefalse for Getty images Alibaba Cloud lies at the heart of Alibaba’s (BABA) robust ecosystem. Its cloud computing arm, known as Alibaba Cloud, was established in 2009, and is now counted among the top echelon of cloud players globally and is emerging as the powerhouse for the company. Alibaba has transformed from an e-commerce player to a leader in the technology and digital economy spaces, making cloud computing an integral part of Alibaba’s long-term strategy. Here’s a closer look at Alibaba Cloud. Alibaba’s cloud computing revenue grew 84% year-over-year to $962 million during the December 2018 quarter. Alibaba Cloud has increased its paying customers at a rapid pace; it has more than one million paying consumers globally. Since it's IPO in 2014, there have been constant comparisons between Alibaba and Amazon.com. The rising importance of Alibaba Cloud (or Aliyun) adds to another point on that list. AWS, the cloud computing arm of Amazon is presently the undisputed leader in this segment and while Amazon has a strong core business, AWS has been a significant 10% to Amazon’s overall business revenue. Likewise, Aliyun is gradually increasing its share in Alibaba’s revenue pie; in Q2 2015, its share was 1.5% which has now moved up to 6%. Alibaba Cloud is still in an absorbing phase where investments made are yet to reap profits. In the past quarter, Adjusted EBITA was a loss of $40 million. Alibaba Cloud is expanding at a fast pace and once its services build scale, its potential would start to reflect in Alibaba’s bottom line. In November 2018, Alibaba Cloud became the first-ever Chinese company to be included in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems. It is already a part of the Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Data Management Solutions for Analytics. Alibaba Cloud ranked fourth on the list of worldwide cloud infrastructure market with a 4% share in 2018 growing at 91.8% vis-à-vis 2017. AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are ahead of Alibaba Cloud. In the APAC region, Alibaba ranked second in terms of public IaaS and PaaS service revenues. The robustness of Alibaba Cloud was proved yet again during its busiest business day of the year—the Global Shopping Festival 2018, which recorded $30.8 billion sales in 24 hours. Alibaba strongly believes that computing power is the key to applying advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to businesses. During the Cloud Computing Conference 2018 in Hangzhou, Alibaba said it was establishing a chip company, a subsidiary under the Alibaba Group that will “focus on customized AI chips and embedded processors to further support Alibaba’s growing cloud and Internet of Things businesses, as well as to provide intelligent solutions for different industries.” Alibaba Cloud is enhancing its presence footprint in newer markets. Alibaba Cloud has a growing network of data centers across countries and regions, including India, Indonesia, Dubai, Malaysia, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Germany, the U.S. and UK. While Alibaba Cloud is gradually expanding its global footprint, it is already the undisputed leader in China with a 43% share in public cloud market in 2018. It is estimated that, “roughly 40% of the top 500 enterprises and 50% of listed companies in China are using Alibaba Cloud.” During 2018, Alibaba Cloud entered into collaborations with a number of universities for various projects including the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the University of Macau, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, the engineering school Télécom ParisTech and National University of Singapore. Alibaba Cloud expanded its Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) offering to major global markets including South East Asia, the U.S and Europe. Alibaba Cloud's BaaS supports enterprise-level blockchain applications on the two platforms of Hyperledger Fabric and Ant Blockchain. It launched the superconducting quantum computing cloud in collaboration with Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), featuring a quantum processor with 11 quantum bits (qubits) of power. New partnerships were entered with Bosch, Commvault, InterContinental Hotels Group, VMware, Siemens, Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife of the Republic of Kenya, SAP and KPMG, among others. At the Mobile World Congress in February 2019, Alibaba released seven new solutions, and two new features for the international markets. The launch comes after its proven in-house usage across various businesses within the Alibaba Group, including retail, fintech, logistics, media and entertainment, digital branding and marketing. In future, almost every business would rely on cloud in some form, creating a huge demand. The worldwide public cloud services market is projected to reach $278.3 billion by 2021 from $175.8 billion in 2018. Alibaba Cloud has immense potential to offer proven, scalable, and secure technologies to customers world over and is thus emerging as a strong player among the global hyperscale cloud providers. Its importance for Alibaba is reflected in the statement by Daniel Zhang, CEO, Alibaba Group, “Our growth is driven by the power of Alibaba’s cloud and data technology that helps expedite the digital transformation of millions of enterprises.”",Prableen Bajpai,"March 14, 2019, 02:03:36 PM EDT",Alibaba Cloud Lies At The Heart Of BABA'S Business Strategy,0,0,1,1,1,0,-1,1,1,1
161," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD ) shows early signs of readying for another breakout. Trading close to its 52-week high of $190.88, the food retailer agreed to acquire an Israeli digital startup for around $300 million. This buy should further advance the company's already-solid implementation of simple store-level technology solutions. With MCD stock valued at 21 times forward earnings, investors may look for McDonald's to accelerate its revenue growth.  For a rumored $300 million, McDonald's is getting personalization and decision-logic technology developed by Dynamic Yield. That tech will enable the fast-food purveyor to more closely match its offerings to what its consumers want. Through an outdoor digital drive-through, customers get a more-immersive, personalized experience from McDonald's menu items. And by combining the trending food items of the day, time of day, current weather, and current restaurant traffic, the technology will help guide the customer through the decision-making process. Things have certainly come a long way from ""would you like fries with that?"". McDonald's is leveraging its brick-and-mortar retail fronts with the latest technology. What better way to compete with online-only restaurants and other firms that use apps and online channels to take orders ahead of time? McDonald's will also integrate this technology into its own mobile app, self-order kiosks, and other digital consumer experience touchpoints.  Ahead of the acquisition news, Cowen had noted that the restaurant chain's renovations will drive continued revenue growth. With strong earnings and sales on the way, the brokerage views MCD stock as a solid defensive play that is also appealing to fixed-income investors. Though the dividend yield of 2.5% is not high, it's still better than that offered by Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). Still, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO ) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP ) offer dividends north of 3%. Pepsi is especially attractive because its P/E is 13.8 times, compared to 24 times with MCD stock. MCD's 24x P/E is low when investors consider the company's growth prospects. Restaurant additions, along with the optimization through renovations and promotions, will ensure steady revenue growth. In 2017 and 2018, the stock traded in a range because McDonald's had only started driving higher traffic growth at its locations. This year, integrating the Dynamic Yield technology and offering UberEATS at most, if not all, of its locations, will fuel higher sales. The beauty of UberEATS is that it increases consumer awareness for the McDonald's brand. And once the customer makes that first order, getting repeat business is easier than winning initial business from those customers. Traffic into fast-food restaurants is on the decline, so McDonald's must differentiate itself from competitors. As more people work from home, the population ages, and habits for eating at fast-food chains change, McDonald's must continue to adapt. The technology changes will most certainly add meaningfully to the bottom line. Offering delivery and changing the customer experience for the better will also offset the macro headwinds McDonald's faces. Analyst sentiment engine Tipranks.com shows that of the 11 analysts covering the stock, eight have a buy rating and three others have a hold. The average price target is 6% above the recent share price of around $187. Using finbox.io to model a fair value for MCD stock with a 5Y DCF growth exit model, assume revenue falls for the next two fiscal years. In this scenario, macro headwinds are hurting all fast-food chains. If revenue recovers in year 5, then McDonald's stock is trading close to fair value. In this downside scenario, MCD has a fair value that is around 5% below the current share price. Buying MCD stock today is low risk. The company continues to put its customers at the forefront of growing the business. And few firms ever fail to grow when enhancing the customer experience to drive repeat sales higher. That is the case for McDonald's stock. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Topolsky is best known for being one of the founding editors   of The Verge. Following a brief stint at Bloomberg, he went on to   found The Outline in 2016. The site has been positioned as a niche digital magazine not   playing to search engines and easy clicks, complete with the tag   line ""It's not for everyone, it's for you."" However, the plan to sell this more exclusive approach to   brand with heavy pockets may not have worked as intended, with   Recode reporting that The Outline generated less than $1 million   in revenue in 2018. As a consequence, The Outline laid off all of   its staff writers last year, resulting in boycott campaign from   freelance writers.

169,"Shutterstock images When one company buys another, the reaction in the two stocks is usually pretty predictable. When ABC buys XYZ, they pay a premium over XYZ’s market price, so that stock rises to just below the price being paid with the difference reflecting the risk of failure inherent in any announced deal. Stock in the acquiring company tends to move the other way, falling to take account of the massive initial expenditure. So, when both stocks climb on the announcement of a deal, as happened this week when Nvidia (NVDA) announced their buyout of Mellanox (MLNX), investors should take notice. In effect, what the market is saying in a situation like this is that the buyer, in this case Nvidia, got a good deal simply in terms of the price paid, but there are other factors that influence the immediate reaction, such as the fit between the two and the vision for the new company. When those things are considered, this looks like a great deal for Nvidia and even after the jump in NVDA that followed the news, the stock looks like a solid buy.   Not that long ago, Nvidia was a fairly unremarkable maker of video graphics cards for PCs and just three years ago, the stock was trading in the $20s. What nobody imagined back then was that the bet the company had taken on artificial intelligence (AI) would pay off in the way it has. This deal represents the next stage in that bet. Advances in the field have taken the idea of computers that essentially think for themselves from science fiction to an everyday reality, and NVDA's rapid rise reflects the company’s strong position in the market. Mellanox is a world leader in the infrastructure, hardware, and software for servers and data storage. If you have been following business news at all in the last few years, you will know that that too is an area of massive growth, and that there is a seemingly endless demand for the kind of computing power that Nvidia delivers. The strategic fit for these two companies is obvious, and the deal represents a merger of two companies with established profit records and solid free cash flow. Because of that, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s claim that the deal will be immediately accretive to Nvidia’s earnings looks realistic and the synergies will lead to a healthy operating margin. As important as all that is to the initial market reaction to the deal, it is the long-term prospects for the combined business that should excite investors. The digitized world in which we live is awash with data. That creates ethical problems as to who that actually belongs to and what can be done with it, but those problems will be addressed and don’t change the basic fact that the demand for the storage and processing that the new, combined company will service is huge and growing exponentially. That growth is best served by seamless integration throughout, and that is what Nvidia will now be able to provide. The technical picture is also encouraging. As you can see from the second chart above, when the market corrected in Q4 last year, NVDA got hit particularly hard. The stock lost well over fifty percent over those three months as valuation worries added to the fears of the possible effects of a global slowdown and disruption of China/US trade. Now that slide has halted, though, the chart shows an inverted head and shoulders pattern and a recent series of higher lows and higher highs, both of which are extremely bullish. The diversification that comes from this deal should limit extreme reactions to market conditions such as we saw on that drop in the future and, with a good technical setup being a short-term plus and the combined company having a huge market share in one of the fastest growing businesses there is, NVDA looks cheap at these levels.",Martin Tillier,"March 14, 2019, 10:35:19 AM EDT","In A Buyout, When The Buyer's Stock Rises, Investors Should Pay Attention",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Univision has been a pioneer in Latin music,"" said Univision   Radio president Jesus Lara in an interview with   Variety    this week. However, Lara admitted that Univision didn't have a   good track record of coordinating its efforts across TV, local   radio and online. That's where Uforia comes in, which the company   recently refreshed as a brand for all of its music efforts going   forward.  makeArticleAd(); Part of these efforts is the new Uforia app, which Lara   described as fine-tuned to Univision's audience. ""The Hispanic   marketplace is a complex one,"" he said, with Cuban-Americans   preferring different tunes than music fans with a Mexican or   Guatemalan heritage. Napster CEO Bill Patrizio argued that the Spotify's and Apple   Music's of this world were often missing those nuances, and in   turn ignoring Univision's audience. ""They are poorly served by   today's mainstream music services,"" he said. Uforia's promise to Hispanic music fans is to go deep. ""We   contextualize the programming,"" said Lara, citing the recent   International Women's Day as an example. For that day, Uforia's   curators created a number of playlists, including one of   women-only Mariachi bands, and one of female Reggaeton   artists. And there is another difference between Uforia and Spotify, or   Apple Music for that matter. Univision's music app is free for   all, with no upsell to a paid plan. ""My audience is accustomed to   and doesn't mind the advertising for a free service,"" said Lara,   adding that his company currently had no plans for a paid   tier. ""Not all roads lead to $9.99 a month,"" agreed Patrizio. He   likened today's streaming market to a pre-internet world, when   record labels focused on CDs, and tried to sell the same product   for the same price point to everyone. ""It's inevitable that we   are going to see greater segmentation,"" he said. Napster has been a music streaming pioneer in its own right,   launching the first all-you-can-eat subscription service under   its Rhapsody brand all the way back in 2001. Facing stiff   competition from Spotify and Apple, the company has shifted more   of its focus to B2B,   powering music apps from iHeartRadio and   others    . But Patrizio said that Napster would continue to capitalize on   its brand going forward. ""We will not become some nameless,   faceless white label provider that no one has ever heard of,"" he   said. As for Uforia, the revamped app with a Napster-powered music   streaming experience is available for iOS and Android now. The   app will get podcasts soon, and both Lara and Patrizio hinted at   plans to more directly integrate Univision radio feeds with   Napster's music catalog.

175,"Pixelworks ( PXLW ) operates with a fairly stable projector business, a growing video delivery business, and potentially a very meaningful mobile business. This article is an update to my original piece on Pixelworks which can be found here . The last time I wrote about Pixelworks, its mobile business was just a concept - namely, it had a mobile chip, but no customers. Since that time, the company has secured four customers for its Iris chips; HMD's Nokia, Xiaomi's Black Shark, ZTE, and Asus. Nokia is the customer that has the most potential currently. While an Iris chip is currently only in the 7.1 model, the companies have signed a strategic agreement where Pixelworks' chips will be incorporated into an increasing number of Nokia handsets. Nokia shipped 4.8 million smartphones in Q3 2018 and was the fastest growing manufacturer in that time period. If Pixelworks is able to be designed into 10 million Nokia phones annually at a $2 ASP, that would result in a $20 million incremental revenue stream for the company, huge relative to the $77 million in revenue the company did in 2018. Black Shark is a growing power in the gaming phone market, with volumes that are becoming more meaningful in each successive generation. The first model in early 2018 only shipped to China, but each successive model is being distributed to an increasing global footprint. ZTE was considered a high potential customer, but then, the US Justice Department clamped down on companies supplying ZTE, and even after that constraint was lifted, ZTE models have done poorly in the marketplace to the detriment of Pixelworks. Asus is a niche player without significant volumes to date. There are many more phone manufacturers in Pixelworks' pipeline, and the company's chips become more and more attractive with each successive generation (now on Iris Gen 5) as they shrink in size and use less power. The potential is there for this unit to show additional explosive growth with a design win with a high-volume manufacturer such as an Oppo or a Vivo. This week, Pixelworks announced a software license agreement with Qualcomm ( QCOM ) where a software version of Iris with limited functionality would be integrated with Qualcomm's application processor. This opens up a new potential market of customers who only need the limited functionality and wouldn't buy a physical Iris chip. This partnership is also very important because Qualcomm is working with Pixelworks rather than developing its own display processing technology, eliminating a prior overhang to the story. There are two potential growth avenues in this business unit. Pixelworks is currently selling into the Japanese market transcoding chips used in converter boxes and PVRs which allow customers to view 4K video on their TVs that were made before the new national standard was implemented. This business is growing quickly now and will probably grow for two to three years before maturing. The other opportunity is the OTA (Over the Air) market for cord cutters. Pixelworks' chips allow for the streaming of OTA content throughout the users' homes and even to their cellphones when away from home. This is a nascent market, but Pixelworks already has an important design win with Sling TV and is working on others. Projector This market continues to be fairly stable with one caveat. Last year, Pixelworks co-designed a chip for its largest projector customer, which it finished at the end of the year. On the negative side, this chip will have a lower ASP than the preceding generation but will be partially made up by a higher gross margin on these chips. This change will provide some headwind to the top line once these chips are rolled out, which could take a few years. From a valuation perspective, Pixelworks remains extremely inexpensive. Trading at an EV/Revenue multiple of 1.6x 2019E revenue, the company trades well below similar semiconductor companies with comparable gross margins. We expect multiple expansion to occur when mobile revenues begin to ramp and put fair value at 3x revenue or $6.65, representing 85% upside from current levels.

177,"By Landon Manning IBM (IBM) is teaming up with a group of credit unions based in Denver, Colorado, to pursue the integration of blockchain technology. Forbesdescribed some of the specifics surrounding this plan, which will see IBM and CULedger offer blockchain-based services “to help credit unions provide their members with greater efficiencies and an enhanced user experience.” CULedger has an international reach with credit unions in several nations worldwide. The main thrust of this plan is to create an immutable audit trail using blockchain technology “to create new business models and transform existing business processes for credit unions.” Considering the borderless nature of blockchains, this initiative pairs up nicely with CULedger’s stated goal of reaching users abroad. Forbes noted that the total assets of credit unions worldwide are valued at nearly $2 trillion. Last December, CULedger got its first serious taste of enterprise blockchain software when it became a part of R3’s decentralized ecosystem. Running apps on its Corda distributed ledger, R3 has made several attempts to transform the distributed ledger technology space with enterprise applications. This new partnership with IBM should provide CULedger with greatly expanded potential for working with overseas credit unions. Currently, IBM also operates live blockchain projects across “financial services, supply chain, government, retail, digital rights management and healthcare sectors” all around the world. Forbes reported that in the last year and a half, the company has undertaken new initiatives with major companies based in Denmark and China. John Ainsworth, CULedger’s founder and CEO, claimed that a “cooperative model that helps improve the member experience while benefiting all credit unions is the ideal approach to ensuring the next wave of financial innovation.” He added that his company is “creating a network through which all members can join and access new services and enabling credit unions to become even more competitive while addressing new market dynamics where members are demanding even more for their financial services provider. Forbes also described some of the specifics of a new digital identity credential that CULedger will be implementing, called MyCUID. Using blockchain technology to create a self-sovereign identity system, this program will allow users to participate with any member credit unions worldwide.",Bitcoin Magazine,"March 13, 2019, 02:37:37 PM EDT",IBM and CULedger Partner on Enterprise Blockchain Project for Credit Unions,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

180,"The financial services sector is often viewed as a value proposition, not a destination for investors seeking growth. Fintech is reshaping the growth proposition in the normally staid financial services sector and investors can tap that growth with exchange traded funds (ETFs), such as the Global X FinTech ETF (FINX). FINX debuted in September 2016 and tracks the Indxx Global FinTech Thematic Index. While the ETF is not as seasoned as other traditional financial services funds, FINX reflects the growth opportunities available in the fintech space. For the two years ended March 11, 2019, FINX returned nearly 70 percent, topping the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) by a margin of more than 7-to-1. FINX follows the Indxx Global FinTech Thematic Index and is home to companies looking to “transform established industries like insurance, investing, fundraising, and third-party lending through unique mobile and digital solutions,” according to Global X. Fintech Growth Financial disruptors residing on the FINX roster include Intuit Inc. (INTU), SS&C; Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SSNC) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL). That trio, which combines for over 18 percent of FINX's weight, is up an average of 29.37 percent over the past year. These companies and others FINX components are driving positive change and disruption in everyday financial services. “We’ve reached an inflection point in 'fintech,' where early disrupters are moving from challengers to industry leaders in their own right, as they expand their services, develop their brands, and increase market share,” according to Fortune. Digital payments is one of the primary growth frontiers for the fintech industry, a trend expected to benefit FINX holdings such as PayPal and Square Inc. (SQ). As the chart below indicates, the value of digital payment transactions is expected to undergo exponential growth over the next several years.  (Courtesy: Statista) A Conventional Approach FINX is not a run-of-the-mill financial services ETF, but it is cap-weighted, meaning it uses a conventional weighting methodogy. That means larger fintech companies, such as Intuit and PayPal, command bigger percentages of the ETF's weight while stocks with smaller market values are less prominent on the FINX roster. While some issuers of thematic ETFs eschew cap weighting, FINX investors could be well-served by that weighting scheme. “While some might argue that in the aggregate smaller companies offer higher growth opportunities than larger companies and therefore warrant more exposure than a market cap weighting scheme offers, we do not always find this to be the case in disruptive industries,” according to Global X research. “Using history as our guide, recent powerful themes have demonstrated that larger companies enjoy enormous benefits due to economies of scale and network effects.” The 37 holdings in FINX have weights ranging from 0.13 percent to 6.65 percent. The average market value of those holdings is $13 billion, putting FINX at the lower end of the large-cap spectrum.",Todd Shriber,"March 13, 2019, 11:29:23 AM EDT",A Fantastic Fintech ETF,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

185," TOKYO, March 6 (Reuters) - Former Nissan Motor Co  Chairman Carlos Ghosn was set to be released on $8.9 million bail on Wednesday after a Tokyo court rejected a last-minute attempt by prosecutors to keep the once-feted executive in prison. Ghosn, a former titan of the global auto industry, has spent more than 100 days detained in a small, unheated room since his Nov. 19 arrest for alleged financial misconduct. The Tokyo District Court on Tuesday granted his release on 1 billion yen ($8.9 million) bail after his lawyers assured the court that Ghosn would submit to extensive surveillance. News of the successful bail request on Tuesday sent hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV crews racing to the detention centre in eastern Tokyo. Many camped there overnight to secure places for their equipment. Ghosn faces charges of aggravated breach of trust and under-reporting his compensation to the tune of $82 million at Nissan for nearly a decade. If convicted on all the charges, he faces up to a decade in jail. The ex-chairman of Nissan, Renault SA  and Mitsubishi Motors Corp  has denied any wrongdoing. ""I am innocent and totally committed to vigorously defending myself in a fair trial against these meritless and unsubstantiated accusations,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday. The case has cast a harsh light on Japan's criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defense lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day. Ghosn last month hired lawyer Junichiro Hironaka, nicknamed ""the Razor"" for his success in several high-profile cases, to lead his case. Though the granting of bail represents a significant development, Ghosn still faces a criminal justice system in which only three of every 100 defendants who plead not guilty are acquitted. There is also no plea-bargaining mechanism that would allow Ghosn to agree to lesser charges for a lighter sentence.

186," By Saumya Joseph March 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it approved a Johnson & Johnson  nasal spray antidepressant for people resistant to other treatments but placed restrictions on use of the drug, which it warned could be misused and abused. The approval of nasal spray esketamine marks the first new type of treatment for depression in more than 30 years and has raised hopes for its relatively fast action and ability to treat some otherwise unreachable patients. Currently available anti-depressants such as Eli Lilly and Co's  Prozac work on neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, but most drugs take at least four weeks to show effect and fail to produce an adequate response in about 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). ""Spravato has the potential to change the treatment paradigm and offer new hope to the estimated one-third of people with major depressive disorder who have not responded to existing therapies,"" said Mathai Mammen, global head of J&J's Janssen Research & Development. Spravato has been touted as an asset with blockbuster potential and is expected to improve investor sentiment toward the growth prospects of J&J's pharma unit Janssen, as its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade faces increased competition from cheaper biosimilars. The treatment carries a boxed warning - FDA's harshest - flagging the risk for sedation and difficulty with attention, judgment and thinking, abuse and misuse, and suicidal thoughts after administration of the drug. Spravato is absorbed by the lining of the nasal passages and into the blood stream and will be used along with a newly prescribed oral antidepressant, Johnson & Johnson said in a .  (graphic). During clinical trials, Spravato was found to relieve depression symptoms within 24 hours in some patients, said Janssen spokesman Greg Panico. The approval comes after an FDA advisory panel in February voted heavily in favor of the drug esketamine, saying its benefits outweighed the risks. However, the panel members echoed concerns raised by FDA staffers regarding the increased risk of sedation, dissociation and higher blood pressure observed in the study. The drug is also being tested in patients with depression who are at a high risk of committing suicide. Recent research shows that depression involves deterioration of the quality and number of nerve cell connections in areas of the brain related to mood. J&J's drug helps restore these nerve cell connections in the brain, leading to an improvement in depression symptoms, according to the company.",,"March 05, 2019, 07:43:00 PM EDT",FDA approves J&J's ketamine-like nasal spray for depression,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,1,0,-1

Prysmian revised up on Tuesday total savings it expected from buying U.S. firm General Cable to 175 million euros ($198 million) from 150 million euros and said it would achieve them by 2021, a year earlier than previously forecast. Prysmian said it was making 95 million euros of provisions for 2018 at WesternLink, a high-voltage cable connection from Scotland to England. ""The adverse effects generated by the WesternLink provisions were mainly offset by the improved margins reported by Telecom and High Voltage Underground, as well as the synergies arising on the integration with General Cable"" the company said. Prysmian had cut its target in June for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) due to additional costs at the WesternLink project. On Tuesday, Chief Executive Valerio Battista described the Westernlink issue as a ""one off"", adding: ""We cannot be 100 percent sure that other issues will not occur, but we are reasonably confident.""

193," By Ernest Scheyder and Liana B. Baker March 5 (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp's  top shareholder said on Tuesday  the miner should focus on striking a joint venture deal in Nevada with rival Newmont Mining Corp  before considering a full-blown merger. ""My preference is a joint venture,"" Joe Foster of the Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund, said in a phone interview. ""I don't flat out oppose a merger. If a merger is the only way to unify Nevada then maybe, just maybe, that's something we might consider. But as it stands the best path right now is to form a JV in Nevada."" Newmont said it prefers a joint venture in the state, a plan Barrick says would be too complicated and not financially beneficial to all shareholders. A Nevada joint venture ""would avoid exposing our investors to the complexity and significant risk that would come with combining the two companies,"" Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said on Tuesday in response to Foster's comments. Barrick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Barrick Chief Executive Mark Bristow told Reuters on Monday he was ready to seriously negotiate a Nevada joint venture. Bristow and Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg were meeting Tuesday in New York to discuss Newmont's proposal for the joint venture, which was unveiled earlier this week, according to sources familiar with the matter. Van Eck owns about 110 million shares of Barrick, or about 6.4 percent of the company, making it the largest shareholder. The fund is also owns about 7 percent of Newmont, making it the third-largest shareholder, with roughly 31 million shares. Foster said he recognized that Bristow and Goldberg were ""miles apart on a JV agreement,"" but urged them to hash out a deal. ""These companies pay these guys a lot of money. They need to find a place in the middle where they can come together and create value for shareholders,"" Foster said. If there is no other way to combine the Nevada properties, a merger is ""one way to create that value."" But Foster said a merger would create a ""monstrous"" gold company.",,"March 05, 2019, 02:02:00 PM EDT",Top Barrick shareholder urges joint venture in Nevada with Newmont,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
194,"Get ready for robotic speakers to whizz around in your living   room while you are having fun in      virtual reality    : Samsung subsidiary   Harman    got   a patent awarded    this week to map sounds from   virtual reality    (VR) games and experiences to one or more robotic speakers. The patented technology is meant to deal with a shortcoming of   traditional speaker systems for VR: They just don't work that   well for spatial audio. ""Audio content that is outputted via static audio devices may   not accurately represent the virtual environment and/or virtual   objects included in the virtual environment,"" the patent reads in   part. ""For example, sounds outputted by stationary speakers may   not accurately reflect the distance, direction, and/or motion   between the user and a virtual object included in the virtual   environment.""makeArticleAd(); As a remedy for this, Harman is looking to map VR soundscapes   to robotic speakers, and then move them around in a room.   According to the patent, this could reproduce a wide range of   acoustic phenomenons, including objects emitting sounds   themselves, as well as walls that sound can bounce off, physical   obstructions that can absorb sound, and more. ""The audio that the user hears matches more closely with user   expectations for the audio based on what the user sees in the   virtual reality content,"" according to the patent. ""Consequently,   the audio facilitates a more immersive virtual reality   experience."" However, the system is not necessarily meant to reproduce   every sound. One example mentioned in the patent is inner   monologue in narrative VR experiences. From the patent: ""Speech   from a character may be more suitable for output via a robotic   speaker (…) than speech corresponding to an inner monologue from   the user representation, because a sense of space and distance is   generally not required for an inner monologue."" The patent goes into some detail about ways to track the   position of robotic speakers in the room, and ways to position   the speakers themselves. Turns out these devices don't   necessarily need to drive around on four wheels, with Harman   researchers envisioning anything from one-wheelers to ""a hovering   mobility platform based on co-axial rotors, multi-rotors (e.g.,   quadcopters), or vertical gas jet based propulsion mobility   platforms."" Does this mean that VR users will soon have an army of speaker   drones buzzing around their heads? Not necessarily. First, it's   worth pointing out that companies patent technologies all the   time that don't end up becoming real products. One could also   make the case that a lot of these issues could be solved much   easier with smart spatial sound and a good pair of   headphones. However, as location-based virtual reality evolves to become a   sort of high-tech amusement park, it's easy to imagine that   companies like The Void may one day not just use physical props,   but also spatially mapped audio playing from real speakers to   create immersive entertainment experiences.

195," By Elizabeth Dilts NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc  said on Tuesday that it is relaxing the dress code for all its employees, a move once considered unimaginable for the Wall Street firm's leagues of monk-shoed partners and bankers in bespoke suits. The new ""firm wide flexible dress code"" was announced in an internal memo, which said the shift was due to ""the changing nature of workplaces generally in favor of a more casual environment."" Historically known as a white-shoe investment bank, Goldman Sachs traditionally required formal business attire. But since 2017, the bank began relaxing its dress code for employees in the technology division and other new digital businesses. This created a divide in the workforce as clear as denim versus pinstripes. Like other Wall Street banks, Goldman has been competing to secure the best employees. Large technology firms and hedge funds often have more relaxed offices and perks. Tuesday's announcement was also meant to bring the bank's traditional policies up to date for its younger workforce. More than 75 percent of Goldman employees are members of the Millennial or Gen Z generations--people born after 1981. The memo did not specify which clothes are or are not appropriate. ""All of us know what is and is not appropriate for the workplace,"" the memo reads. The memo also reminded employees to dress ""in a manner that is consistent"" with clients' expectations. ""Of course, casual dress is not appropriate every day and for every interaction and we trust you will consistently exercise good judgment in this regard.""

197," By Tracy Rucinski March 5 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines  fueled the appetite of planemakers on Tuesday after Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the airline planned to replace some 200 Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft over the next decade. The plans come as the second largest U.S. airline seeks to grow internationally, though Bastian said at a conference that the company had not yet decided whether to invest in struggling Italian carrier Alitalia. Delta is ""very interested"" and in discussions with Boeing about its proposed new midsized airplane, known as the NMA, Bastian said. Boeing will decide in 2020 whether to produce the plane which industry sources say would have two aisles and seat seven across. The plane aims to address the so-called middle of the jet market between traditional narrowbody jets with one aisle and long-distance widebody planes. ""Hopefully they'll decide to go,"" Bastian said. Delta is already in the process of replacing one-third of its mainline fleet, one of the largest and oldest among U.S. airlines, in the next five years. Delta shares were up 2.5 percent at $50.03 in afternoon trading after Bastian said spring and summer travel demand was solid.  ALITALIA INVESTMENT? Bastian said it was too early to decide whether to invest in Alitalia, which was put under special administration in 2017 after workers rejected the latest in a long line of rescue plans, leaving the Italian government seeking a buyer to save the airline. Italy's state-controlled railway Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) said last month it would start negotiations with Delta and EasyJet Plc  to draft a rescue plan, the third in a decade, for the struggling airline. Delta executives have held talks in Rome in recent weeks, according to Italian industry sources, but doubts remain whether an outside investor would be willing to take a minority stake in the strike-prone airline. Bastian said that the numbers being thrown around for Alitalia are ""pretty large"" and ""not the kind of numbers that we're considering, just to quell any concerns."" Still, he said it makes sense to consider an investment in Italy, an important market for U.S. consumers, and noted that   Delta's global growth over time will skew toward international rather than congested domestic markets. That growth could come through direct investments in overseas carriers.

206,"Getty images Tesla (TSLA) shareholders have experienced a bumpy ride so far in 2019. With the stock down more than 14% year to date, compared with an 11% rise in the S&P; 500 index, the market has seemingly voted against the company’s decision to cut the price of its flagship Model 3 sedan. But are we missing the big picture? On Friday the stock dropped almost 9% after the company announced late Thursday it would offer a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan. Not only did this news come several months before initially planned, Tesla also said it would close many of its retail stores worldwide. This news comes off the heels of the first batch of February delivery estimates, which — to some observers — weren’t as robust as they could be when compared to fourth quarter 2018 deliveries. What really upset investors, however, was the significant price cuts for all Tesla models. Which is understandable, given the company’s continued need to raise capital. In a conference call with CNBC, CEO Elon Musk didn’t try to hide this fact, telling investors that the company would not turn a profit in the first quarter, but expected a return to profitability in the second quarter. Tesla shares closed Monday at $285.36, losing almost 10% just in the past thirty days. This could be a good buying opportunity, however. Making the Model 3 more affordable and thus more mainstream, has been the point all along in enabling Tesla to compete with the likes for Ford (F) and General Motors (GM). For that to happen, it required a radical shift in the company’s strategy. One of the ways to achieve this, Tesla said it was shifting sales entirely online, which explains why it opted to close many of its retail stores, which the Musk says will become “information centers.” “Shifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing is to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected,” Musk noted in a blog post. These steps, in my estimation, are designed to do two things: First, as we have learned from Apple (AAPL), online orders is a great way to post demand. Second, and perhaps, most important, Tesla will also be able to cut massive overhead costs. Tesla recognizes the cars literally sell themselves. It doesn’t need salespeople to explain features that can be conveyed on a website or phone app. The company said the speed of the new $35,000 version, which can go from zero to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, would top out at 130 miles per hour. But for only $2,000 more, customers can get a Model 3 that with a range of 240 miles and a top speed of 140 mph. ""This is a game changer,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives told Reuters in a telephone interview.

211,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings results after the closing bell Monday. The software-as-a-service and cloud giant is expected to report a monster quarter, if you listen to the words of co-CEO Keith Block. Salesforce’s customer relationship management services are a must-have for many companies looking to add capabilities such as sales, marketing, e-commerce and analytics. “Companies across every industry, in every geography have a mandate to digitally transform their businesses and are turning to Salesforce as a strategic partner,” Block said in prepared statements last quarter. But strong revenue and earnings growth projections are par for the course for the enterprise cloud giant, which has topped or matched the Street’s earnings estimates in eighteen straight quarters. When the numbers are officially released, the only question is, how high can Salesforce stock fly? Shares are trading at 52-week highs and have risen 20% year to date, crushing the 11% rise in the S&P; 500 index. And yet there are reasons to suspect the stock might actually be cheap. The company’s projected earnings growth rate is 27.5% annually over the next five years. And this is despite the industry being highly competitive, where rivals such as Adobe (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL) are growing market share. As such, Salesforce’s guidance and its billings forecast will be the most closely-watched aspects of Monday’s report. For the quarter that ended January, Wall Street expects the San Francisco-based company to earn 50 cents per share on revenue of $3.37 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 39 cents per share on revenue of $2.68 billion. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 93% year over year to $2.61 per share, while revenue of $13.24 billion would mark a 26.3% increase year over year. Global expansion continues to be one of the main drivers of the company’s growth. Businesses of all sizes and industries recognize the need for a digital transformation. Salesforce’s ability to offer integrated solutions, combined with strategic partnerships with titans like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL) has given it a key competitive advantage in terms of its international reach. In the third quarter, revenues from Europe and Asia Pacific jumped 31% and 26%, respectively, outpacing the 25% rise in the Americas. Those are good signs that Salesforce is growing revenue to an extent that can offset saturation fears in the U.S. On Monday Wall Street will look to see if these trends can continue. And investors will be watching to see to what extent the company can realistically achieve its goal of reaching revenue of $20 billion by 2022.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 04, 2019, 07:58:41 AM EDT",Salesforce (CRM) 4th Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
212,"Chris Helgren - Reuters Getting a ride to anywhere in the United States has never been easier since the arrival of Lyft (LYFT) and Uber, whose long-term mission is to end car ownership. These two rivals, arguably, helped usher in what is called the sharing economy — a community where consumers have access to or can provide goods and services to others (whether free or for a fee) via an on-line platform. For Lyft, which got its start as a college carpooling service called Zimride in 2007, will beat its rival to the public market. On Friday, Lyft filed IPO documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is set to become the first app-based ride-hail company to go public. Lyft, which will list on Nasdaq under the ticker “LYFT,” aims to raise as much as $100 million in its IPO — a figure that’s likely to change, based on investor demand. And given the recent successes of Spotify (SPOT), there’s a strong chance that demand for Lyft — a so-called unicorn — will be high, especially given the company’s recent achievements. In its IPO documents, Lyft said its U.S. market share as of December 2018 reached 39%. That 39% figure marks a 17 percentage-point increase from the 22% it had in December 2016. The company, which had 18.6 million “Active Riders” and over 1.1 million drivers for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, attributed the tremendous share growth to securing not only new riders and drivers, but also more frequent rides from existing customers. But here’s the thing: Despite these impressive numbers, Lyft has lost nearly $2.3 billion over the past three years. Its net loss climbed to $911 million in 2018, up from $688 million in 2017, prompting some criticism on Wall Street. To be fair, Lyft is not the only tech company to have adopted the strategy of “if we build it, they will come.” Both Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) has made investors rich by betting on themselves. Sure, Lyft’s losses are important to keep note of. And the company has disclosed that fact among its risk factors, stating ""we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.” But for some context, Uber has reported losses for of more than $8 billion since it was founded nine years ago, including losing more than $1 billion on revenue of $2.95 billion in the most-recent quarter, according to The Wall Street Journal. I won’t ignore that Lyft, which has been aggressively courting riders by heavily discounting its fares, potentially faces a long road towards profitability. But burning through cash in the early days of a startup in order to gain market share is nothing new. As noted, both Amazon and Netflix, which sought to disrupt existing industries, lost billions for years and experienced tons of speed bumps before turning a profit. It’s something Tesla (TSLA) is now experiencing as well. So how will Lyft be greeted when it officially begins trading? That remains to be seen. But I would put Lyft stock at the top of the list of IPOs with billion-dollar valuations that investors are (or should be) eager to jump into, including yours truly.",Richard Saintvilus,"March 04, 2019, 07:56:07 AM EDT",Lyft (LYFT) Beats Uber To IPO: What to Expect,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

216," While robots have been a fantastical part of sci-fi Hollywood movies over the years, whether it's Arnold as the Terminator or the various machines of the Matrix, they are now much closer to reality, and more useful. Robots are fast becoming a part of the world around us, helping as assistants for elderly care, providing support in medical procedures and surgeries, carrying out cumbersome and risky processes in mines and industries, and much more. Here’s a look at the robotic revolution and how investors can invest in this space. IDC forecasts that the worldwide spending on robotics systems and drones will be $115.7 billion in 2019 (robotic systems alone at $103.4 billion) and is expected to reach $210.3 billion by 2022. Another report estimates that the revenue in the global robotics market would touch $147.26 billion by the end of 2025, growing at a 17.4% CAGR between 2017-2015. While the projected numbers vary, they reflect the same trend. The world robotics report shows that a new record high of 381,000 units of industrial robots were shipped globally in 2017 and is expected to reach about 630,000 units by 2021. The annual sales volume of industrial robots increased by 114% over the last five years (2013-2017). The sales value was at $16.2 billion in 2017 vis-à-vis 2016. China, Japan, South Korea, the U.S. and Germany are the biggest market for industrial robots. Meanwhile, the sale of service robots increased by 85% during 2017 while there was a 39% increase in sales value. The service robots segment includes both professional (use in logistics, medical) and personal use robots. While robotics is enhancing productivity and competitiveness, there is an uneasiness regarding its impact on the manual job market. Many reports and scholars have painted a dark picture on the rise of robotics. While some fears are justified, there is equal or more evidence to the contrary. A report by IFR reads, “automation does not lead to job substitution, but rather to a reallocation of both jobs and tasks in which robots complement and augment human labor by performing routine or dangerous tasks.” Further, an MIT technology review highlights how “humans and robots collaborating efficiently can be more productive than teams made of either humans or robots alone with a 85% reduction in human idle time.” The use of robotics is said to be a great boon for manufacturing. In October 2018, a BCG report underlined that the U.S. urgently needs a more aggressive approach to developing and adopting robotic technologies for manufacturing, to increase its competitiveness and to boost its economy. “Robotics will drive productivity enhancements, to compensate for a labor shortage and to counteract declining productivity growth. And a thriving domestic robotics industry will enhance America’s global competitiveness during a period of intensifying trade conflict,” read the report. Investing Opportunities For those looking to invest in robotics, there are two broader options. The first is to invest in companies that make robots or its components; some of the companies operating in the field of robotics include, among others: The second way is to invest via exchange traded funds (ETFs). ETFs provide a cost-efficient, transparent and convenient access to investing across companies and geographies. Here are some of the ETFs focused on robotics and artificial intelligence: Launched in 2013, ROBO Global Robotics & Automation ETF (ROBO) was the first robotics and automation ETF providing investors access to rapidly evolving robotics, automation and AI companies across 14 nations. It has a portfolio of 94 companies with less than 20% allocation towards the top ten stock holdings which include FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR), Brooks Automation, Inc. (BRKS), Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG), Aervironment, Inc. and FANUC Corp. The ETF has $1.36 billion as assets under management (AUM) and its geographical portfolio is weighted towards the U.S. and Japan. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) launched in 2016 provides exposure to companies that potentially stand to benefit from increased adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) across industries. The ETF has $1.5 billion as assets under management and tracks the Indxx Global Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index. The top five stock holdings—Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Keyence Corp. (KYCCF), Mitsubishi Electric Corp., ABB Ltd, and Fanuc Corp (FANUY)—add to 36.13% while 60.13% of the portfolio is concentrated in the top ten stocks. Next is the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (IRBO). It tracks an index composed of developed and emerging market companies that could benefit from the long-term growth and innovation in robotics technologies and artificial intelligence. The ETF has the highest exposure to the U.S. and China in terms of geographical composition. Launched in 2018, the ETF has a portfolio of 97 holdings with 29.59 million as assets under management. The top ten stock holdings have a 15.05% allocation with Cloudera, Inc. (CLDR), Snap Inc Class A (SNAP), Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC), iQIYI, Inc.(IQ) and Stratasys Ltd (SSYS) as the top five stocks. Launched in 2018, First Trust NASDAQ Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (ROBT) tracks the Nasdaq CTA Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Index which is composed of companies engaged in the artificial intelligence and robotics segment of the technology, industrial, medical and other economic sectors. The Index includes “companies in artificial intelligence or robotics that are classified as either enablers, engagers or enhancers.” The ETF has a geographical exposure is tilted towards the U.S. and Japan and has Xilinx, Inc. (XLNX), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), iRobot Corporation, ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) as its top stock holdings. The top ten stocks have a 23.28% allocation.

225,"Dell Technologies (DELL) is set to release fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results after Thursday’s closing bell. Investors are eager to see what the tech giant reveals in its first quarterly results since it returned to the public market last December. And a good return it has been. Shares of the PC and data-storage giant have climbed 15% year to date, including 20% gains over the past month and besting the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P; 500 index. The company, which has three key operating segments, is benefiting from a combination of factors — namely its improved revenue in its Client Solutions Group and Infrastructure Solutions Group. Dell is also seeing market share gains in its PC division. Notably, this is despite Gartner reporting a global PC decline in the fourth quarter. Last month Citi Research analyst Jim Suva initiated coverage of Dell shares with a Buy rating and $55 price target, noting that the current valuation discount of 40% to 50% to its peers is too wide given ""a much more favorable product offering.” Suva might be on to something. Fast forward a few weeks later, Dell shares have already surpassed Suva’s target. Will its numbers on Thursday call for a target upgrade? For the three months that ended December, Wall Street expects the Round Rock, TX.-based company to earn $1.89 per share on revenue of $23.46 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.14 per share on revenue of $19.63 billion. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 38% year over year to $6.57 per share, while full-year revenue of $90.97 billion would rise 13.8% year over year. In the third quarter, the company delivered revenue of $22.5 billion. Though that marked an impressive 15% year-over-year increase, the company generated an operating loss of $356 million. On an adjusted basis, it generated an operating income of $2.1 billion, but it was down 2% from the year prior. In other words, the report was a mixed bag. On Thursday Wall Street will want Dell, which is projected to deliver a 7% jump Q4 revenues, show that it can also grow its bottom line. Its adjusted full-year earnings are expected to rise about 7.3%. This is important given the company’s debt load which has become a concern for investors. Much of this debt, estimated to be $50.3 billion, is from Dell’s $67 billion buyout of EMC. In the past two years, it has paid down almost $15 billion in gross debt, including roughly $1.3 billion in Q3. As such, profits will remain constrained for the foreseeable future and underscores the importance of the cash flow generation. Good news is, Dell, which is expected to benefit from its dominant position in the enterprise IT solutions market, ended Q3 with a cash and investments balance of $20.4 billion. Investors will be looking to see if this figure can rise in 2019 and how much of the company’s cash will go towards debt retirement.",Richard Saintvilus,"February 28, 2019, 08:14:58 AM EDT",Dell (DELL) Fourth Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Alongside the analysis of the sectoral forces at work, Moody's analysts -- including senior vice president Bill Wolfe -- weighed in on their credit impacts to Canadian companies. Among the highlights: - Moody's said the ongoing internetization of communications and commerce will accelerate in 2019-20 as fifth-generation (5G) wireless protocols and improved satellite internet capabilities augment ongoing improvements in 'last-mile connectivity.' - It added 5G wireless and improved satellite internet capabilities both represent ""positive steps"" in last-mile connectivity, but network providers' financial returns from them are ""uncertain."" - According to Moody's, three main disruptive forces will continue in 2019-20: direct-to-consumer (DTC) communications, which disintermediate network-dependent services; access to by-product information, which redistributes advertising spending; and global reach, which amplifies economies of scale. - Moody's noted both mobile and fixed-line internet is steadily growing over time, and younger demographics display higher penetration and spending rates.",MT Newswires,"February 27, 2019, 03:53:38 PM EDT","Technology Sector Update for 02/27/2019: BCE.TO, T.TO, SJR-B.TO",0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,1,0,-1

228,"By Jimmy Zhong, CEO of IOST, the application-friendly, next generation public blockchain infrastructure, helping decentralized app developers overcome some of the most challenging problems with mass adoption. Since its inception, advocates of blockchain technology have been working towards mainstream adoption. In the past year, many have weighed in on how and when this may occur, but most have agreed that enterprises and consumers face significant barriers when it comes to incorporating this technology into their operations and their daily lives. While many projects race to build the infrastructure that may one day serve as the basis for exponential mainstream adoption, the power of supporting real, functioning, decentralized apps, also known as DApps, for users to engage with is often overlooked. It is entirely possible that a breakthrough in mainstream adoption across industries such as banking and financial markets, gaming, and healthcare will not be awarded to the project with the best technology. Indeed, a breakthrough in mainstream adoption will depend heavily on the usability and popularity of the applications themselves. In its current state, access to the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry is largely limited. Users can only own cryptocurrencies by mining or purchasing their cryptocurrency of choice on an exchange – activities that require a fair amount of technical and background knowledge, ranging from knowledge of computer science to complex KYC and trading processes. Unless the industry opens up a better dialogue with the users it is trying to target, adoption rates will stagnate. To prevent a standstill, the industry could take a leaf out of AOL’s book in the early internet era, when the company started distributing free CDs, packaged attractively with content, through door-to-door mailing. This made it easier and more appealing for everyday people who hadn’t used online services to trial AOL’s offering. In the same vein, the best approach to encouraging the adoption of blockchain technology may be to promote this level of inclusiveness and lower the barriers to entry, giving people easy access to participate in industry growth in meaningful ways. At this point in time, users need a Mail app to send and receive emails, not a smtp or POP3 protocol. The industry must build applications for users wherein the use of cryptocurrency makes sense and benefits them, something that IOST is focusing on. There are several applications that are making strides when it comes to giving users easy access to cryptocurrency. Existing DApps such as Bermi, a social network that rewards users for creating and engaging with short videos, ActiFit, which enables users to earn from their everyday movements and exercise, and Ethlend, a peer-to-peer lending platform, possess low barriers to entry and allow users to familiarize themselves with earning and spending cryptocurrencies to engage with the DApps’ purpose. This in turn gradually embeds the idea of smart contracts into the user experience, making users actually adopt the infrastructure of blockchain. While the uptake of DApps will span many industries and use cases, gaming is the current poster child for the adoption of smart contract technology. Tokenizing real-world assets such as art and real estate comes with the cost and inconvenience of auditing and custodial solutions, and since the majority of business logic in gaming is already coded online, blockchain adoption is made easy and human interaction is unnecessary. In this way, token rewards can be easily distributed to gamers in a more transparent manner. When it comes to other major industries, particularly banking and financial markets, healthcare, entertainment, and general enterprise, promising use cases are coming to the fore through DApp development, but adoption is proving far more challenging. Projects such as Rate3, an identity management platform, Aragon, a digital business register, and Brave, a fast and private browser, are certainly advancing their respective industry applications. However, to date, disruption through DApps has been difficult to get off the ground, as much of the capital has been raised by larger blockchain infrastructures. To take the industry to its next stage of growth, and toward mainstream acceptance and mass use, larger projects have a duty to work with funding partners to allocate resources to promising individual DApps. Incubators and accelerators like Bluehill can help to support developers of DApps and provide the tools needed to launch valuable applications for consumers and enterprises. Modelling after its success in launching DApp projects in network security, payment processing, and content distribution, other VCs and incubators should give more attention to helping DApp developers build real-world applications. Only then will we see more industries beyond gaming move to blockchain. As the blockchain industry remains optimistic about a future where this technology permeates almost every aspect of our lives, it is now critical for influential players to set their sights on demonstrating the tangible benefits and value that DApps can offer. If not, we risk blockchain pursued for the sake of blockchain.",Guest Contributors,"February 27, 2019, 02:37:27 PM EDT",DApps in Focus: Moving Beyond the Infrastructure and Toward Mass Use,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,-1,0,-1

232," Payments processing specialist Square (SQ) will report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. Just how much has the company’s payment ecosystem grown during the recent rise of the fintech industry? The company is coming off its sixth straight quarter of accelerated revenue growth. Understandably, expectations remain high as Q4 estimates calls for growth of 61% year over year. Another area analysts will focus on will be Square’s gross payment volume (GPV), which has surged more than 30% year over year in the previous two quarters. It’s for this reason shares of the payment processor have skyrocketed 35% year to date, including 10% over the past month. Notably, even with the strong stock surge, the shares rest some 25% off their 52-week high. The good news is that the company continues to add to its ecosystem of products and services. The company’s Cash App, which stands out among competitors like PayPal (PYPL) is one example. It goes without saying Square needs a strong earnings report Wednesday to keep this impressive rally going. For the three months that ended December, Wall Street expects the San Francisco, Calif.-based company to earn 14 cents per share on revenue of $454.1 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 8 cents per share on revenue of $282.66 million. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 66% year over year to 46 cents per share, while full-year revenue of $1.58 billion would rise 60% year over year. In the third quarter, the company delivered revenue growth of 51% year over year, while adjusted — excluding the acquisitions of Zesty and Weebly — revenue rose almost 70%. Just as impressive was Square's profitability, where adjusted EBITDA increased 107% year over year to $71 million. On Wednesday, analysts will look to see whether these growth trends can continue in 2019, particularly in terms of EBITDA margin. Led by CEO Jack Dorsey, Square has made aggressive moves to grow beyond just a card reader platform to a service that provides businesses with a host of payroll tools, employee management, and analytics. These moves have paid off as the company now generates a sizable chunk of revenue from these service subscriptions as well as things like business loans from Square Capital, which aims to provide financing and bank loans to small businesses. The company on Wednesday must demonstrate the strength of Square Capital and guide in a way that suggests it can become the growth contributor it has been touted to be. Elsewhere, analysts will also focus on operating expense and the extent to which Square will begin to shift its focus towards boosting profitability and cash flow. To the extent these metrics can continue to improve, Square stock might have only begun to rise.",Richard Saintvilus,"February 27, 2019, 08:15:49 AM EDT",Square (SQ) 4th Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
233,"Shares of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) have surged some 17% so far in 2019, besting the 11% rise of the S&P; 500 index. And for the company to maintain its outperformance, it must project confidence when it reports first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. This is because after two straight quarters of growth, PC shipments declined for both the fourth quarter and year in 2018, according to data released last Thursday from research firm Gartner. Owing to a shortage of CPUs (central processing units) which created supply chain issues, Global PC sales fell 4.3% to 68.6 million units in Q4, and 1.3% to 259.4 million in 2018, the firm noted. During the quarter HP, which lead in global PC sales for much of 2018, fell out of the top spot in, coming in second to China’s Lenovo’s (LNVGY). Despite the slump in PC shipments, Lenovo’s market share during the quarter grew to 24.2% from 21.9% and to 22.5% from 20.8% for the year, overtaking HP, Gartner noted. How much of this weakness will impact HP’s top and bottom lines? Those are some of the more pressing questions investors will hope the company will answer. Given the stock’s year-to-date performance, investors don’t appear too worried. But to keep the stock heading in the right direction, HP will need to show it can grow its profit margins, while issuing confident revenue guidance. For the quarter that ended January, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company is expected to earn 52 cents per share on revenue of $14.88 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 48 cents per share on revenue of $14.52 billion. For the full year, ending in October, earnings are projected to increase 9% year over year to $2.20 per share, while full-year revenue of $59.63 billion would mark a 2% year-over-year rise. In the fourth quarter the company delivered revenue of $14.59 billion, which surpassed Street estimates by $320 million, while adjusted EPS of 52 cents came in a penny above the Street. As evident by the recent drop in the stock price it would seem investors haven’t forgotten the suffering they’ve been through when HP suffered multiple quarters of revenue declines dating back to 2010. In the fourth quarter, the company’s revenue results came in ahead of consensus, coming in at $15.4 billion, beating the $15.1 billion that analysts were calling for. Profits of $1.5 billion, or 54 cents per share on an adjusted basis, matched expectations and garnered an applause by investors, sending the stock surging in the after-hour session. That’s because the figure was also 10% better on a year over year basis. The company’s outlook for fiscal 2019, however, is what investors will focus on to determining the real value of HP shares. This is because the company’s revenue growth is expected to take a slight dip this fiscal year. There are also questions as to the extent the company’s improving PC and Printer businesses, which drove positive earnings in fiscal 2018, can continue to drive market share gains.",Richard Saintvilus,"February 27, 2019, 08:12:15 AM EDT",Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) 1st Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

235,"Tech giants get the headlines, but there’s plenty of action and opportunity among the smaller firms as well. Wall Street’s top-rated analysts have taken note, including several from the Top 25 in the TipRanks database. TipRanks analyzes the analysts, rating over 5,000 experts from Wall Street’s best firms based on the accuracy and success of their stock ratings. Let’s see what they have to say about three buy-rated companies which have shown significant share-price gains in recent weeks. HubSpot, Inc. (HUBS – Research Report) HubSpot is both a smaller player and big name in the tech world. The company, which boasts a market cap of $6.7 billion, is known as an innovator in inbound marketing software, whose products ease the lives of social media marketers, content managers, and SEO optimization experts. HubSpot operates on the “freemium” model, offering a number of services without charge, with upgrades and premium services available through paid subscription. The model works for them. Earlier this month, HUBS reported EPS of 37 cents, beating the forecast 30 cents by 23%. Gross revenues were also up, at $144 million. This was 4.7% over the estimates, and well above the year-ago quarter’s $106.5 million. Canaccord analyst Richard Davis (Track Record & Ratings), rated #1 overall in the TipRanks database, saw the Q4 results as solid, noting the company’s “…customer additions, strong business trends, upside to free cash flow, and better than average fundamentals.” He raised his price target to $190, suggesting an 11% upside for HUBS shares. Writing for Rosenblatt Security, Marshall Senk (Track Record & Ratings), another five-star analyst, agrees with Davis’ view of this stock. In his comments, Senk says, “HubSpot delivered a very strong fourth quarter with the subscription line exceeding our estimate by $6 million with that out-performance driving better-than-expected bottom line results. “We are increasing our 2019 and 2020 estimates to reflect both the strong new product offerings and the improved go-to market plan.” Senk also raised his price target, to $182, implying a modest, though real, upside potential of 7%. HubSpot currently holds a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating from the analyst consensus, based on 10 buy and 4 hold reviews. The average price target is $187, which gives a 10% upside to the current share price of $170.  LivePerson, Inc. (LPSN – Research Report) This company, based in New York City, offers real-time messaging platforms for websites and social networks, on desktop and mobile devices. LivePerson’s products are a boon for customer service departments, and lead the way in conversational commerce. That said, LivePerson’s recently quarterly earnings did not light a fire under anyone. The company missed on EPS, posting 1 cent against an expected 2 cents, while revenues were high at $65.72 million. While EPS was low, the revenues represented a gain of $8.33 million over the previous Q4. Stock watchers took their cue from company CEO Rob LoCascio, who said, “We expect our revenue growth rate to ramp toward 20% by year-end in 2019 and to exceed it 20% in 2020 as we take a greater share of emerging multibillion-dollar market opportunity.” LPSN shares are up more than $2 since the Q4 report. Ryan MacDonald (Track Record & Ratings), from Needham & Company, wrote, “LivePerson continues to report strong metrics that support a continued reacceleration of growth.” He points out higher than expected forward guidance, and raised his price target to $30, indicating a 6.5% upside. Oppenheimer’s Koji Ikeda (Track Record & Ratings) also takes an upbeat view of LivePerson. In his comments on the stock, he noted several strong notes from the Q4 report: “Total revenue of $65.7M was ~$600K above consensus; and adjusted EBITDA of $5.3M was ~$200K above consensus. 1Q total revenue guidance of $65.75-66.75M is in line with the $66.1M consensus.” Ikeda’s price target, $33, suggests a 17% upside to LPSN. Overall, LivePerson gets a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating, based on 7 recent buy reviews. LPSN shares hold a 14% upside potential, based on an average price target of $32 and a share price of $27.  RingCentral, Inc. (RNG – Research Report) RingCentral combines telecommunications with the tech sector, offering a cloud-based business telephone system as its flagship product. Using cloud software lowers the cost for customers, while still providing tradition business telephone services: universal telephone numbers, fax, voice mail, and call forwarding. A strong product underlay an expectation-beating Q4 earnings report. The forecast called for 18 cents per share in earnings based on $181 million in sales; the reality was 23 cents EPS and $189 million in revenues. It was good news all around, with five-star analysts taking note and raising their price targets on RNG. First up was Terry Tillman (Track Record & Ratings) from SunTrust Robinson. Tillman noted “continued momentum with key growth and upside driver, that included a 60% increase in enterprise/mid-market business and stronger channel sales.” His price target, $120, gives a 13% upside to RNG. Next up was Brian Peterson (Track Record & Ratings), of Raymond James. Peterson set a $117 price target, suggesting an upside potential of 10%, and pointed out “RingCentral's earnings beat was highlighted by 34 percent growth in total revenue to $188.6 million. The company benefited from continued momentum across key growth channels like enterprise where annual recurring revenue rose 99 percent from last year.” Peterson also noted that RingCentral benefitted from a below-average churn rate. Finally, the #6-rated analyst in TipRanks’ database, Oppenheimer’s Brian Schwartz (Track Record & Ratings), also gave RNG a price target of $117. Schwartz noted that revenue and subscription guidance suggest a possible slowdown in the second half of 2019, but believes that is outweighed by the company’s strengths. Of those strengths, he said, “On the positive end, the quarter marks the highest upside in revenue growth and absolute dollars in 10 quarters. The company secured a record high total contract value deal of at least $10 million in the education sector. Customer retention reached a record high of more than 90 percent.” It’s a rosy picture for RNG, reflected in the ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus. That consensus is based on 9 buy ratings and 2 holds. The current share price of $105 and the average price target of $112 give a comparatively modest upside potential of 6.5%, but these recent analyst reviews suggest that potential may be understated.

246,"By Landon Manning The government of South Australia, one of Australia’s six states, is going to conduct an upcoming election using blockchain technology. Local news sources confirmed that the Australian blockchain company Horizon State was “contracted by the South Australia Government to provide the technology and support for the blockchain-based election.” Horizon State’s CEO Nimo Namaani called the move “an exciting first government use of our tech in Australia, and a great way to validate the blockchain use for this purpose.” He claimed, “The South Australian government is very forward thinking and we are honoured they chose us to provide the technology.” Multiple nations worldwide have already begun experimenting with blockchain-based voting technology. Last November, for example, a major political party in Thailand used distributed ledger technology to conduct primary elections, selecting candidates that would go on to compete in a more conventional election. Similarly, South Korea has also begun to consider how this technology would be implemented in this way. What makes South Australia’s upcoming election noteworthy, however, is the scale on which it will be conducted. Namaani called it “a complex vote — being preferential with reserved seats, and a large cohort of candidates to choose from,” and the blockchain-based vote will be legally binding. Multiple candidates and sitting politicians have voiced their support for this move, with South Australia’s premier Steven Marshall planning to turn the state into the “blockchain capital of the country.” He publicly claimed, “Blockchain [technology] is going to be important into the future as we manage global supply chains,” so it would make sense to get the state’s populace well-acquainted to the technology. As more and more countries worldwide show that distributed ledgers can offer security and fraud prevention to elections at all levels without compromising voter access, the case for widespread adoption will only become more clear. Initiatives like this on the local level lay the groundwork for bold and wide-sweeping changes internationally.",Bitcoin Magazine,"February 25, 2019, 11:15:37 AM EDT",South Australia Joins Regions Leveraging Blockchain Technology for Elections,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,0,0

248,"Revealed – the new Samsung Galaxy S10 will have a built-in crypto wallet! That’s the word spreading fast round the crypto-oriented interwebs over the last few days. There have been rumors of this development since January, when an image leaked of the new phone, showing a blockchain button on the home screen, but Samsung’s February 21 release announcement made it official – the latest Galaxy phone will be pre-enabled for secure storage of crypto keys. For those of you following the ebbs and flows of cryptocurrency, this may not seem the most important development. After all, per CoinWatch.com, the crypto market is down almost 10% in just the last 18 hours, after a solid week or more of gains. So, what can a smartphone company have to do with that? How can Samsung’s wallet app make a difference to the $130 billion cryptocurrency marketplace? Let’s break it all down for those of you are not blockchain geeks. The Patents before the Release January’s rumors did not come out in a vacuum. A month earlier, in December, news broke that Samsung had filed several patents in the European Union’s Intellectual Property Office. The patents locked in three proprietary trademarks, all related to blockchain: “Blockchain KeyStore,” “Blockchain key box,” and “Blockchain Core.” Now, there is nothing unusual about a company filing patents, or filing those patents months or years in advance of releasing the related product. The important point here is that Samsung has, legally, established ownership over these phrases for marketing purposes – and all three phrases relate to storing access data for blockchain applications. And then the images leaked of the blockchain button on the phone. The rumor mill went in to high gear. Securing the Wallet App Now the rumors are confirmed – the Galaxy S10 will have a built-in blockchain app. Which naturally brings us to questions about its use and security. Security first, as that is and always has been a key selling point of blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies. According to the company, “Galaxy S10 is built with defense-grade Samsung Knox, as well as a secure storage backed by hardware, which houses your private keys for blockchain-enabled mobile services.” Knox is Samsung’s solution for mobile security, designed to provide a secure environment for smartphone devices. The company has been using Knox since 2013, and it has received both the US Department of Defense and US National Information Assurance Association security certifications. Knox maintains security by continuously verifying device integrity at the OS and hardware levels. In effect, it isolates the hardware chip on which the wallet app is installed. Samsung also uses the Exynos 9820 application processor, a proprietary device, to create a semiconductor-based cryptographic key for the Galaxy S10. With a cryptocurrency wallet installed on the phone, they are taking security seriously at both the app and device levels. Getting Blockchain to the Masses? The importance of Samsung’s move for cryptocurrencies, and for blockchain as a useful secure-transfer technology, cannot be understated. While the S10 is not the first smartphone with a crypto wallet – China’s Huawei, Taiwan’s HTC, and Sirin Labs all have devices on the market – it is the first by a major manufacturer worldwide reach and reputation. Samsung is the world’s largest smartphone maker. The company holds 18.7% of the market share, and shipped 292 million devices, globally, in 2018. What they do, others will follow, if for no other reason than the sheer necessity of not falling behind. And with an audience that size, the new blockchain wallet feature will reach millions of customers who might otherwise not be exposed to cryptocurrencies. Using Cryptos with the Wallet In early reviews, it appears that Samsung’s app will support both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as default settings. Together these two cryptos hold 63% of the market cap (Ripple’s XRP holds most of the rest), and it appears – although is not confirmed – that the app will include an ‘add more’ feature. Right from the start, this new blockchain wallet will offer S10 users access to two-thirds of the crypto market. In addition, Samsung’s term and conditions for the Blockchain KeyStore – the part of the app that will provide security for the crypto access key – includes a direct statement that inquiries are directed to Samsung’s Payment’s Services Group. This is being taken as a hint that Samsung may, in the near future, begin accepting direct cryptocurrency transfers as payment for services. By providing access to the crypto market, and hinting that it may soon start accepting crypto as payment, Samsung is indicting a tremendous level of support and confidence in cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a transition point; in order to succeed, it needs to break out of its niche market and enter the mainstream. Acceptance by a company of Samsung’s size and reach makes that a distinct possibility. The Bottom Line The Galaxy S10 comes out 10 years after the first Galaxy S model, and, coincidentally, 10 years after Bitcoin heralded crypto’s arrival in the markets. The new phone will be a direct competitor with Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone X models in the top-end smartphone niche. In that competition, the new blockchain wallet may be an important feature in customer decisions. In any case, we’ll find more when the phone starts shipping on March 8.

249,"The hedge funds’ 13F filing season generates a blizzard of raw data, and the sheer volume is a tad overwhelming. Fortunately, the major financial players will throw that data to teams of analysts, who wade in undaunted, and re-release the figures in distilled form. The result: hedge fund trends become easily discernable. So, let’s thank Citi Research for comparing the 13Fs of the 50 largest hedge funds, and telling us where those funds were investing in the last quarter. The results are interesting; the four most popular stocks bought by those hedge funds were Facebook, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. It was a who’s who of big tech companies, the ones that have made headlines, sometimes for the wrong reasons, but usually for gigantism: huge companies, huge share prices, huge returns, and huge profits. Let’s look into TipRanks’ database, and see what the top Wall Street analysts are saying about these companies now. Facebook, Inc. (FB – Research Report) Facebook, more specifically, Mark Zuckerberg, has been hammered in the headlines for much of the last year and half. From testifying to Congress, to getting caught up in data privacy scandals, it just seems that Zuckerberg can’t win. Except that the result was that FB stock fell 22% in 2018- and became increasingly reasonable in terms of price. According to data from Citigroup, 15 of the 50 largest funds loaded up on Facebook stock – compared to only 6 in the previous quarter. So far, it seems to have been a good investment, as FB shares are up $30 since the start of the year. Consistently strong financial, typified by a good Q4 earnings report, have boosted Facebook. Analyst Ronald Josey (Track Record & Ratings), of JMP Securities, noted that “renewed confidence that usage, engagement, and monetization can continue to grow meaningfully as investments around Video, Stories, and Messaging, among others, begin to deliver ROI.” He acknowledges that data privacy and security issues remain a concern, but even so, he raised his price target to $195, indicating a 20% upside potential. Merrill Lynch’s Justin Post (Track Record & Ratings) agrees that data privacy may continue to haunt Facebook, and noted that a UK Parliamentary committee has recently released a report on the subject – a concern, since the UK levied a fine of 500,000 pounds on the company after the Cambridge Analytica fiasco last year. Post remains bullish, however, due to FB’s financial situation, confident that the company can weather regulations. His price target is $205, suggesting an upside of 26% to the stock. So it’s no wonder that Facebook retains a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus. Shares are priced at $161, and the average price target of $189 gives a 17% upside. FB’s overall rating is based on an impressive 32 ‘buys,’ with 6 ‘holds’ and 2 ‘sells.’  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT – Research Report) Bill Gates’ baby Microsoft has been around since 1975, so pushing its mid-forties it’s considered old for a tech company. Call it ‘mature middle age.’ It brings certain advantages to a company. For starters, Microsoft has been a recognized and well-known brand for decades. Its Windows OS is ubiquitous, and by putting its Office software on the cloud, it made a good product more convenient for more users. And the company has long ago outgrown the sort of media headlines that have been plaguing Facebook. Citigroup’s data shows that 14 of the largest hedge funds are increasing their MSFT holdings. While this is down from last quarter’s 21, it still represents 28% of the largest funds – clearly, Microsoft offers a strong investment opportunity. Top analysts agree that Microsoft is worth buying. The #3 rated analyst in the TipRanks database, Ross MacMillan (Track Record & Ratings) from RBC Capital, give the stock a solid ‘buy’ rating with a $124 price target – implying an 11% upside. Morgan Stanley’s Keith Weiss (Track Record & Ratings) shares this confidence, shown by his $140 target on MSFT stock. He sees MSFT as a buying opportunity now, and says, “As the IT conversation shifts from pure Public Cloud towards Hybrid Cloud architectures, Microsoft will pull ahead as the best secularly positioned firm in tech. The company's secular positioning and durable growth give it the best risk/reward in software.” Weiss’s price target suggests a 26% upside to this stock. With shares trading at $110, and an average price target of $123, MSFT has an upside of 11%. The stock holds a ‘Strong Buy’ by the analyst consensus, based on 20 ‘buy’ ratings, 1 ‘hold,’ and 1 ‘sell.’  Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL – Research Report) Alphabet’s greatest strength is simultaneously its greatest public liability. Its Google search engine has access to the world’s greatest library of online data – everything from personal search habits to vital stats – and it uses that information to create the perfect platform for targeted online advertising. It’s a product with an unlimited customer base: literally every company with an online presence. That ubiquitous product and near-infinite product reach may explain why 26% of the largest hedge funds – 13 altogether, by Citi’s data – are investing more in GOOGL. The company’s analyst reviews provide additional clarity. Start with Mark Mahaney (Track Record & Ratings), of RBC Capital. Mahaney points out “significant secular growth for internet advertising, very strong market share in core search business, and significant competitive moats.” His price target, $1,300, suggests a 16% upside to GOOGL. Meanwhile SunTrust’s Youssef Squali (Track Record & Ratings) gives greater detail coming to a similar conclusion. He says, “The company's core business of Search and especially YouTube are performing at impressive growth levels, with added support coming from the scaling segments like Cloud, Play, and hardware and emerging ones like Waymo. Expect Alphabet to sustain its mid-teen growth over the next several years with a focus on incremental profit and free cash flows, making the stock an attractive growth story at a compelling valuation.” Squali gives GOOGL shares a 21% upside, with a $1,350 price target. Alphabet’s analyst consensus is another ‘Strong Buy,’ based on 28 ‘buy’ ratings and only 1 ‘hold.’ The stock’s $1,346 average price target and $1,116 current share price suggest a 20% upside potential. Facebook, Microsoft, and Alphabet are huge companies, attracting a great deal of media coverage – some by their own intent, and some by force of circumstance. There’s a tendency among investors and analysts, sometimes, to shun the market’s giants, on the theory that you can find better deals with less baggage elsewhere. The big hedge funds don’t seem to agree in this case, and as our closer look at these three suggests, these whales may actually be right.

250,"Microsoft    unveiled the second generation of its      Hololens augmented reality    headset at a press event in Barcelona Sunday. The new headset   features more than double the field of view of the original   Hololens, according to   Microsoft    technical fellow Alex Kipman, while still offering 47 pixels per   degree of sight.   Say hello to       #HoloLens2        .              pic.twitter.com/eVBQ9OUeM1  - Microsoft       HoloLens        (@HoloLens)       February 24, 2019 makeArticleAd();     Doubling the field of view is a big step for Hololens.   Microsoft has never published the field-of-view data of the   original Hololens, but has been reported to be between 30 and 35   degrees horizontally. The company didn't share exact   field-of-view data about the new headset either Sunday. One of the major new features of Hololens 2 is hand tracking,   which allows users to touch and interact with holograms. In a   demo shown on stage Sunday, Hololens 2 was capable of precisely   tracking each and every finger, allowing users to touch buttons   and even play an AR piano. The headset also comes with integrated eye tracking, and is   meant to be more ergonomic. This includes a display that flips   up, allowing wearers to easily switch between AR and real-world   without having to take off the headset. Microsoft also developed   what Kipman called a ""universal fit system"" for the device - a   subtle dig at the Magic Leap One, which has to be custom-fitted   for each and every user. Microsoft is clearly still positioning the Hololens as a   device for professionals. Kipman was launched on stage by Anand   Argawala, the CEO of Spatial, for a demo of   AR-powered meetings    . Kipman also said that the company has made it easier for   enterprise partners to customize the Hololens hardware to their   own needs. That focus on the enterprise also had a clear impact on the   device pricing: Hololens 2 will cost $3500. The device can be   pre-ordered effective immediately, and will initially be sold in   United States, Japan, China, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom,   Ireland, France, Australia and New Zealand. However, Microsoft also made it clear that it wants to be part   of entertainment - if only the production side, for now. Kipman   was joined on stage by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, who announced   his company was adding Hololens 2 support to the Unreal Engine in   an attempt to bring AR production tools to Hollywood and the   video games industry. Sweeney also hinted at a possibility that some of that   technology will reach consumers at some point, saying: ""In the   years to come, Epic will support Hololens in all of our   endeavors."" In addition to Hololens 2, Microsoft also announced a few   other hardware and software products that will enable   next-generation immersive experiences. These include what the   company calls   Spatial Anchors     - essentially a cloud-based AR solution that makes it   possible to share persistent AR experiences across devices,   including Android and iOS phones as well as Hololens headsets. ""   This will enable the internet of holograms,"" said Kipman. The company also announced remote rendering for AR   experiences, and unveiled a new hardware accessory for the use of   AR and other sensor-rich experiences in enterprises with the   Azure Kinect depth-sensing camera. The Azure Kinect developer kit   will be available for $399.

256,"When Zillow (Z) announced their earnings yesterday, they challenged one well-worn cliché in pursuit of another. It is often said that you cannot go back, but with the current CEO Spencer Rascoff stepping down to make way for former boss Rich Barton, it seems that Zillow is doing just that. Barton, a co-founder of the company along with Lloyd Frink, a partnership that also “founded” Expedia (EXPE) when it was spun off from Microsoft (MSFT), will take over again at a time of big changes for the company. Zillow is known as a property search site but has recently made moves into buying and selling homes as well as mortgage generation. The stock responded positively to the news, it is up over six percent in early trading this morning from yesterday’s close, but is the change significant for investors? The short answer is yes. When companies are undergoing drastic changes, a recognizable, trusted figure at the helm is an important asset. For evidence, I give you Apple (AAPL). Of course, it is possible that Apple would have gone on to the massive success it achieved without the reappointment of Steve Jobs as CEO, but it is hard to imagine it without him. As you can see from the chart below, trust matters to Zillow right now. The news that it had purchased Mortgage Lenders of America last summer was, shall we say, not well received by the market:  That news is not the only reason the stock dropped nearly sixty percent from its high in the second half of last year, but it was the most important one. A generally softer housing market and a drop off in its main revenue source, advertising by real estate agents, also contributed but investors were obviously worried that by moving into flipping properties and providing mortgages, Zillow had bitten off more than it could chew. However, there is another cliché that applies here: in business, if you aren’t going forward, you are going backwards. Barton, with his experience at Expedia, knows that better than most. Tech disruptors can quickly achieve a dominant position in a market, but they are always vulnerable to competition, and for a company whose success is built on rapid growth, standing still is simply not an option. Moving into buying and selling properties and mortgage generation is risky given the cyclical nature of the real estate market, but it plays into a well-known trait of consumers: they're lazy. We like one-stop shopping even, or maybe especially, when it comes to major purchases. There is a reason most car financing is done at dealerships, even though the cut they take from financing deals makes it likely that buyers could get a better deal elsewhere. It's all about convenience. We all like to think that we are rational economic actors who search diligently for the best deal on everything but, in reality, we will often sacrifice economic efficiency for an easy transaction. Searching for a home on Zillow, then buying from them with a mortgage arranged by them may not be the best available deal from an economic perspective, but the company is betting that it will appeal to enough buyers to make it work. I wouldn’t bet against them. The earnings report showed a slight beat on both the top and bottom lines, but not enough to justify the big jump in the stock. That looks to be a reaction to the return of Barton at a critical time for Zillow, and that suggests that investors will give him time to enact the changes. Major changes to a business model usually result in turbulence in a stock but now, with that seemingly behind us, taking a chance on Zillow’s success looks like a decent long-term bet.",Martin Tillier,"February 22, 2019, 10:17:54 AM EDT",Zillow (Z): A Tale of Two Cliches,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

The streaming device   maker told investors Thursday that it projects to generate   between $1 billion and $1.025 billion this year, and that   international growth was one of its key investment areas for   2019.  Roku    made these announcements as part of its   Q4 earnings release    , which showed that it exceeded the market's expectations for the   holiday quarter. The company reported revenue of $275.7 million   for Q4, compared to $188.3 million during the same quarter in   2017. Earnings came in at $5.5 million, compared to $9.5 million   in Q4 of 2017. This translates to earnings of $0.06 per   share. Analysts had expected revenue of $262.11 million, and $0.03   earnings per share. Investors sent Roku's share price up around   4% in after-hours trading, following a 4% decline earlier during   the day.makeArticleAd(); ""2018 was an excellent year for Roku, with record results and   solid progress towards our long-term vision of powering every TV   in the world,"" said CEO Anthony Wood in the company's letter to   investors. ""We believe we are well positioned to deliver another   excellent year."" Roku added close to 8 million active accounts in 2018, and now   has devices in over 27 million households. ""We estimate that   nearly 1 in 5 U.S. TV households now use the Roku platform to   stream at least a portion of their TV viewing,"" Wood said in the   investor letter. A closer look at Roku's numbers showed that the company grew   both its hardware as well as its ads and services business in Q4.   On the hardware side, Roku brought in $124.3 million in revenue,   compared to $102.8 million a year ago. 21% growth for this segment will please investors, who in the   past have been concerned with slowing hardware revenues as usage   shifts from dedicate streaming devices to smart TVs. The   company's hardware gross profit fell by 77%, suggesting a move   towards cheaper hardware as the company emphasizes account   growth. Even more important for the company's bottom line is what Roku   calls its platform revenue - advertising and licensing fees, with   ads making up the majority of that revenue stream. Platform   revenue grew 77% year-over-year, totaling $151.4 million in Q4.   Roku managed to more than double its monetized ad impressions in   2018, the company said Thursday. Roku told investors Thursday that one area of focus for 2019   would be international expansion: ""While we continue to see a lot   of headroom to grow active accounts in the U.S., we are   increasing our investment internationally,"" Wood said in Roku's   letter to investors. However, executives cautioned that these investments wouldn't   pay off over night. Instead, they expect the company to start   accelerating account growth abroad in 2020, with international   revenue following after that. ""You need to build up scale before   you can ramp up monetization,"" said chief financial officer Steve   Louden in an interview with   Variety    Thursday afternoon. Roku currently sells its own streaming devices in 20   countries, including North America, France, the U.K. and a number   of Latin American countries. Louden also shared some perspective on Roku's audio efforts,   which began in earnest with the launch of the Roku Wireless   Speakers last fall. He said that the company purposefully decided   to not sell the speakers, which only work with TVs running Roku's   operating system, in retail stores. ""It is a very limited   offering,"" he admitted, adding that the company would share   further plans for the audio space in the future.

260,"The Institute for Innovation Development has documented our stance that the greatest challenge for advisors today is dealing with a rapidly accelerating rate of business change – an operating environment that we haven’t been previously trained in or been equipped to handle. Technologies driven by FinTech companies are quickly rising to the challenge and providing much needed support, especially in the area of becoming a digital firm. There are explosive gains available right now in operational efficiency, productivity and enhanced profits by shifting traditional practices and legacy systems towards a digital infrastructure. Digitizing enables you to streamline client on-boarding; administrative and compliance workflows; and automates the way front-to-back offices operate, communicate and generate new business. The process of digitizing everything allows for the fluid, efficient control of your company’s data and client information and the increased ability to analyze and glean more insights about your business and your clients. Being a digital firm is the only way to have the business management and innovation agility to learn quickly, experiment with your customers, and pivot your business models to move on new opportunities and truly compete in our new operating environment of accelerating change.  It will equip you with the new level of business flexibility that is mandatory for survival, let alone competitive advantage. To better understand and explore this important issue and how to best engage with digital FinTech solutions, we decided to talk to Institute member Michael Pinsker, Founder & Chairman of Docupace Technologies  – a financial technology company that has created a cloud-based digital operations platform with data driven client onboarding, unified workflow and document management automation capabilities. Our goal is to better understand how to implement a digital transformation for your firm. Hortz:We keep hearing about the crucial need for financial firms to go through a process of digital transformation. What is truly meant by that and why is it so scary sounding? Pinsker: When we talk about digital transformation, we are speaking generally about any business process that uses digital technology instead of paper.  Opportunities for digital optimization exist across all offices and departments within a firm - anywhere from client onboarding to recruiting to basic document handling that is part of any operation of a wealth management firm.  When one looks at the issue of digital transformation, there are many factors that go into figuring out what is right for a given organization. The scary part of it is just that – transformation.  That is because transformation means change and change is difficult; especially when you go from existing paper driven processes to a new way of doing business.  It means policies and procedures will change, the technology will be new, people will have to adapt to different ways of handling tasks. But what I can tell you from extensive experience is that people can manage and embrace change when they are fully aware of and see the scale of benefits for doing so. Educating everyone in advance of the explosive gains in efficiency and competitiveness for the firm can drive wide-scale adoption for that change. Bottom-line reality is, when people realize it is essential, they understand the benefits to themselves and the company, change is very doable and less scary. Hortz:What do you recommend is the most important mindset or approach needed to start this transformation process? Pinsker:  At Docupace, we always advise our clients to start with the questions about the goals of what you are trying to accomplish.  There is a lot that can be done and the transformation process is a journey.  It takes time, but if you have your organizational goals outlined and keep them front and center, it will allow you to ask the right questions, to focus on the right things and achieve the best outcome possible. Hortz:What are the biggest concerns you have seen at this early stage that derail the beginning of the process and how have you best addressed them? Pinsker: We have seen a misalignment within organizations between the stakeholders and people on the ground that caused the process to go south right out of the gate.  To avoid any misunderstandings, our proven methodology calls for the creation of alignment between all stakeholders, client project teams, and Docupace’s professional services team at the start of the process. The other concern is taking on too much initially instead of managing the transformation process in bite chunks in order to build some immediate initial successes and continue to expand on it gradually.  The transformation is a complex multi-phased process and can quickly get out of hands if not managed right from the beginning.  We typically recommend defining the easy win early on and then building on top of it. Hortz:What options do firms have in the implementing stage that may ease some concerns and lead to greater success in the process? Pinsker: There are number of options that firms have to increase the chances of success.  We recommend starting with defining dedicated teams to manage transformation.  The transformation process benefits from having alignment and a focused team greatly increases chances for success. Other options include developing a tighter plan and detailed communication procedures with your technology vendor that is the cornerstone to the transformation.  Establishing a close partnership with the vendor, who is very experienced in driving transformation for similar organizations, is paramount.  It will also help create commitment and remove some of the concerns. Lastly, putting emphases on training and teams support during the transformation process, even after they go live, will have a great impact on the success of the project. Hortz:What then are the specific first steps you suggest firms go through to start the journey? Pinsker: We have put together a detailed  Docupace guide called How to Develop a Paperless Office Strategy which walks wealth management firms step by step through our recommended digital transformation process. The initial steps I would recommend are: Hortz: What other best practices have you seen that drive firms to successful implementation? Pinsker: The best successes we have seen are from the firms that take the transformation seriously and not underestimate the effort and the impact of it.  That is manifested and driven by proactive and consistent communication with stake holders, team members and everyone who is affected by the transformation. I cannot emphasize enough that we see a commitment to training and support - that is focused on adoption of the new way of doing business –as super critical for the long term success of the transformation. Hortz: Any last best advice would you like to share especially to advisors and small-to-midsize financial services firms? Pinsker: While digital transformation is not easy, once you undergo the process, the efficiencies and effectiveness of the organization increases tenfold.  Embrace the change, be thoughtful about what is important in your daily operation and be ready to compromise in order to launch it.  The initial set of processes will be different and may not be perfect, but through the process and continual improvement the result will be amazing. Note that according to a Fidelity study, 97% of advisors who have gone digital have stated that paperless solutions have helped their firms. Most importantly though, your clients will enjoy seeing you using latest and greatest tools as it will help establish better relationships and better connection with them. The Institute for Innovation Development is an educational and business development catalyst for growth-oriented financial advisors and financial services firmsdetermined to lead their businesses in an operating environment of accelerating business and cultural change. We position our members with the necessary ongoing innovation resources and best practices to drive and facilitate their next-generation growth, differentiation and unique community engagement strategies.

263,"Orbit International Corp. (  ORBT  ) is on the cusp of a huge cash flow generation period that, by my estimation, will result in more than half the current market cap in cash. After winning a huge government contract, the company is going to see 2+ years of outsized growth with a record-high backlog of orders. Recent commentary by management suggests this will continue: ""follow-on orders expected on a majority of our major military programs along with several additional opportunities that could result in significant awards""  . The company is set to report 4Q:18 earnings early March, and I believe they will report a record quarterly profit of $0.24, the highest in recent history, show significant cash on the balance sheet, and start distributing this cash in additional dividends and further buybacks. Trading at only 7x my projected 2019 estimates, ORBT stock is a bargain at this price with a terrific margin safety i.e. a cash-rich balance sheet with no debt and a strong order book. ORBT designs and manufactures customized electronic components and power units for military, government, and commercial customers. The company has two divisions; Orbit Electronics Group (OEG) which manufactures and sells keyboards, displays, tablets etc. for the military (drones, helicopters etc.) and commercial companies (Airlines, Air Traffic Control). Customers here include Raytheon ( RTN  ), Boeing ( BA  ), Lockheed Martin ( LMT  ), Northrop Grumman ( NOC  ), and more. The second division is Orbit Power Group (OPG) which manufactures and sells power supplies, frequency converters etc. for military, oil and gas, utilities and rail. Customers include BAE Systems ( BAESF  ), L3 (LLL), Viasat (VSAT), and more. Orbit International was founded in 1957 and has been operating and building government, military, and commercial relationships ever since. The company has a wide range of ""ruggedized"" products, and in many cases, they are the sole source supplier on a number of contracts. Given the company's focus on government and military, there are high barriers to entry in terms of being a qualified supplier. As an example, if both Raytheon and Lockheed were bidding on a contract, no matter who wins, both companies use ORBT as a sub-contractor for certain parts. This puts the company in a solid position to win business and partner with some of the best companies in the world. I have followed ORBT for more than a decade; I have been a shareholder on and off a few times. First in 2005, again in 2009, and now, once again, in 2017 after a major contract win, which I detail further below. My average price is around $5.30. Following ORBT as an investment is more straightforward than most companies because they report a ""backlog"" of orders, i.e. business that has been won, and they now are in the process of fulfilling and booking revenue. Tracking the backlog of small companies is one of my favorite things to do. It allows you to time your entry and exit much better than many other companies. Backlog also gives you a margin of safety, reducing the element of surprise and giving you a better chance of predicting and modeling out future earnings and cash flow. This brings us to a little background, so that we have some context as to where we stand today relative to the past.  In 2003, ORBT earned $0.55 per share on $17mln in revenue, while the stock was around $6.80, the Enterprise Value was roughly $27mln, and the company had net cash of only $0.18 per share. At that point, the backlog was $10mln. By the 3rd Quarter of 2004, the backlog had increased to almost $13mln and by year-end, the company had earnings of $0.62 on $18mln in revenue, and a closing price of around $7.30 (an Enterprise Value of $30mln). Then, throughout 2005, the company won multiple awards, and by June, the backlog had risen to $14.5mln, and for the first 9 months, ORBT's earnings were $0.51 putting them on track for a record year. At that time, the stock peaked at almost $14 per share, valuing the company at around $65mln. In 2006, the backlog started to decline and so did earnings. The stock fell all the way back into the $4s but then recovered as the backlog increased to $16.9mln in mid-2007. The stock was rangebound between $7 and $9 with a steady Enterprise Value of $30mln to $40mln. During the financial crisis of 2008, the stock fell below $2 and like most companies, business dried up, margins started to fall, and ORBT suffered net losses (-$0.37 and -$0.03 in 2009 and 2010, respectively). However, by mid-2010, the company's backlog hit a record $21.2mln, and the company earned $0.67/share in 2011, causing the stock to rally from the sub $2 level to the mid $5s. By this time, the company had almost $4mln in debt, and at that $5.35 peak stock price, the Enterprise Value was around $28mln. The purpose of the above history study is to help put into context where the company stands today. ORBT started 2018 with a record 26.6mln backlog, on pace to report a record $0.72 per share in earnings with an enterprise value of only $15mln! The reason we are now getting all of this for such a low Enterprise Value is due to shrewd work by a great management team. Mitchell Binder took over as CEO in late 2010 and began a major cost-cutting plan and rightsizing of the business to maximize shareholder value. I have spoken to Mitch frequently over the past decade, and he is the quintessential ""stock price"" CEO, and by that, I mean he is focused on doing the right things to increase shareholder value. From late 2010 to now, Mitch has closed offices/facilities, cut expenses, de-listed the stock and reduced the share count by more than $1mln shares (almost a quarter of the market cap). During the years of 2009 to 2011, SG&A was running around $10mln when Binder took over. That number has steadily declined to around the current $6.5mln and has remained stable in that range ever since. In most of the earnings press releases, management has gone out of its way to reference the stable cost structure and to reiterate that these costs will not go up. In the most recen t report  ed quarter (3Q:18), management noted… "" Selling, general and administrative costs decreased     during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to our     tight management of costs"" Even with earnings on pace for a record year and with a huge backlog of orders, management was able to reduce SG&A in this most recent third quarter (3Q:18). The company's new cost structure was not Binder's only pursuit, as he also delisted the company's stock from the NASDAQ, saving roughly $350k a year (which adds almost $0.10 to annual earnings) and paid down all debt using the now solid cash flow generation, new business/EPS rebound and a lower cost structure. He did not stop there. He also had the fortitude to start buying back stock. I am not a big fan of stock buybacks unless your stock is clearly undervalued, or if you know business is about to get much better. In ORBT's case, it was both. The company started buying back stock in the low $3s, and as noted above, they have reduced the share count by almost one quarter. On September 19th, 2017, ORBT won a contract from the government for $21.7mln  to deliver 180 Common Aircraft Armament Test Sets (CAATS). To put that into perspective, that's a whole year's worth of revenue booked on one day! It's the largest contract they have ever won, and the initial orders against that contract sent the backlog to a record $26.6mln. In the press release announcing this contract, management noted that the gross margin will be lower but that "" no additional engineering, selling and administrative personnel will be needed; therefore, this contract should have a positive impact on incremental profitability during the delivery period."" This gets us to our earnings model for the duration of this contract:  Source: Model by author, using company reported data, and   author's estimates As per my model, above, you can see the new contract flowing through the numbers. I model it at roughly $2.2mln a quarter (very top column). I have estimated the normal revenue run rate of recurring business and other new orders running at around $5mln a quarter and add the CAATS contract onto that. I use a new lower gross margin as per management's guidance in the announcement press release. I take the recent historic 38-40% and blend it to low 20% for the CAATS orders to arrive at 32%. This gross margin could be a bit high or a bit low, but we will find out when they report their first full CAATS sellthrough quarter, which is this upcoming 4th quarter of 2018 (reported in about two weeks). The current $22.5mln backlog only includes about three quarters of the original order since only about $15mln was awarded so far. I expect to see another $4-6mln order announced within the next few weeks and combined with the almost $5mln in orders reported monthly in 4Q, my guess is that ORBT ends up with a record backlog again going into the back half of 2019. In the most recent press release, management said: "" Our consolidated outlook for 2019 remains positive with     follow-on orders expected on a majority of our major military     programs along with several additional opportunities that could     result in significant awards…"" If this is true and they do end up getting more ""significant awards"", this backlog will stay elevated through 2021. But, for now, purely with what we have right now, I model the company generating $2.8mln and $2.7mln in net income for 2019 and 2020. The company has NOLs that prevent them from paying taxes for at least the next four or five years. In the 2016 annual report, the company noted they had more than $10mln in NOLs. Here is the exact excerpt: ""The Company also has federal and New York state net     operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10,000,000 and     $700,000, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The net operating     loss carryforwards expire from 2018 through 2034"" I would estimate that NOL carryforward is now closer to $9mln. However, that is still a large number relative. I estimate the company ended 2018 with about $4mln ($1.12 per share) in cash and because they currently pay nominal taxes and have minimal CAPEX requirements, that elevated income goes straight to cash. For the first 9 months of 2018, CAPEX was only $180K and only $29k and $47K in 2017 and 2016, respectively. I estimated that cash balance will grow to almost $10mln by the end of 2020 due to cash generated from this large backlog and an additional but separate $573k tax refund they are expecting from the government due to the new tax laws recently past. At this point, ORBT will have cash of almost $3 per share, more than half the current stock price. If the backlog continues to be elevated or even normalizes and they earn $0.50 a year following the CAATS contract, cash should continue to accumulate, and in three or four years from now, the entire market cap could be cash! ORBT still has a buyback plan in place. As their tangible book value grows, I believe they will continue to buy back stock, but I think the focus has now shifted to dividends. The company started paying a $0.01 quarterly dividend ($0.04 annually), but in the press release, the company also said: ""Furthermore, the Company announced its intention to pay     quarterly and annual cash dividends to holders of its common     stock."" I believe there is a good chance that ORBT will also pay an annual special dividend to shareholders in the next few weeks, and as I said before, they are very shareholder-friendly and focused on enhancing shareholder value. The CEO used the words: ""our Board of Directors has determined that a cash dividend     also be utilized as part of our capital allocation strategy to     enhance shareholder value"". By buying shares of ORBT here, investors are essentially buying into a business on the verge of a multiyear cash flow generation surge. When you pull up ORBT's customers like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, you see them winning large government contracts on a global scale almost daily. ORBT is a key partner to these companies, so you have to believe that their future is at least decent if not bright. This is especially relevant if you think about the precarious situation the world is in right now from Russia to North Korea to the Middle East, to name a few. The current administration's focus on military spending seems to be positive, and I see no reason why this shouldn't continue for the foreseeable future. Technology has improved leaps and bounds these past few years, and I would imagine there are tons of upgrades that need to be made to military and government agencies around the world. If you look back at the early 2000s, ORBT was earning less than what we expect today with far less cash and much higher expense structure. The company had an Enterprise Value at one point of $65mln, and then again in 2011, when business wasn't nearly as good as now, they had an Enterprise Value of $28mln. When these new numbers flow through the P&L in 2019 and 2020 and when people see the sort of cash ORBT is on pace to generate relative to the current EV of only $15mln (and will be close to only $10mln in a year or two), you have to believe the stock will go up. If they do end up with cash of $10mln by the end of 2020 and they do, in fact, earn my projected $0.77 that will equate to an EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.4x, while ORBT's customers and partners mentioned above are trading at 9x. It seems reasonable to expect the stock to increase in value as earnings improve in 2019 and 2020, especially relative to the current EV of only ~$15m. And if it doesn't, I plan on sitting back and collecting dividends, quarterly and annually! Because the company is essentially ""dark"", info can be found on Bloomberg and on the company's website  and then also on OTC Markets.com  with the best and most relevant info under ""Filings and Disclosures"". It's important to note, however, that despite being on the Pinksheets, the company issues regular press releases on time earnings reports and filings, and management is very accessible. Investors should realize that the tax shield provided by the NOLs won't be permanent … it's unclear exactly where the NOLs stand, but with close to $9mln in NOLs, I do not expect the company to be taxed within the next four to five years, and after that, a 20%-25% tax rate should not impact the company too severely, especially compared to the old pre-tax cut 38% rate. The biggest risk is that government spending on the military dries up, and after a few good years we have had, this spending slows down, and ORBT's backlog declines, and the company's earnings fall. That's very possible, but it's hard to prognosticate what will happen, given the current state of the world. I can easily see spending staying where it is, especially given a need for just a basic general ""tech upgrade"" like LCD smart panels, keyboards, drones etc. Another question or risk to consider is the possibility that large defense contractors like RTN and LMT develop some of ORBT's products in house. I believe this is unlikely, given that the business ORBT focused on would be a drop in the bucket relative to the size of those companies. Furthermore, ORBT has built a niche as an add on partner, and there is likely not enough value add for these companies to play in this small niche area. For the next 18-24 months and probably long after that, shareholders of ORBT can get excited about and look forward to quarterly earnings press releases that we believe are going to show hugely positive numbers. Investors can also look forward to collecting a small quarterly dividend but also get excited about larger annual dividends.

265,"Shutterstock photo The driverless vehicle race is being run on computing power instead of horse power. This shift has created opportunities for companies other than OEM (original equipment manufacturers) to be a part of the increasingly software-driven automotive world. Intel (INTC) is one name which is on its way to become a dominant force in this space. Here’s a look at some developments made by Intel in 2018. Intel announced its restructuring in 2016 from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices. Intel’s foray into the autonomous driving segment soon followed. BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye joined hands to create a safe and advanced platform fully automated driving. A few months later, Intel announced an investment of $250 million for autonomous driving which was followed by setting up of a new business unit called the Automated Driving Group (ADG), dedicated to the next generation of advanced driver assist systems and autonomous driving solutions. The acquisition of Mobileye in 2017 for $15.3 billion was Intel's big step in its self-driving journey. In January 2018, Mobileye and NavInfo collaborated to build and distribute Mobileye’s Road Experience Management (REM) product in China.  Mobileye’s Road Experience Management (REM) program enables the creation of precision maps at scale and low cost by leveraging the proliferation of camera-based safety systems on cars. An innovative, low cost and efficient solution to enable autonomous vehicles to localize themselves (precision localization) is a critical sensory input for the safe and affordable adoption of autonomous vehicles, right from Level 2+ (partial automation) systems to Level 5 (full automation). In addition to NavInfo, China’s SAIC entered a new collaboration with Mobileye develop Level3/Level4/Level5 autonomous vehicles as well as bring REM mapping to China. China has ambitious plans for self-driving technology. China expects smart cars with partially or fully autonomous functions to account for 50% of new vehicles sold in the country by 2020. In mid-2018, Baidu and Mobileye decided to work together towards safer autonomous vehicles. While great progress has been made by Baidu with more than a hundred global partners for Apollo, a number of challenges remain. To deliver safer self-driving technology, Baidu and Intel are collaborating to integrate and commercially deploy Mobileye’s Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) model in both the open source Project Apollo and commercial Apollo Pilot programs. “RSS formalizes human notions of safe driving into a verifiable model with logically provable rules, defines appropriate responses, and ensures that only safe decisions are made by the automated vehicle.” Intel is collaborating with companies such as Volkswagen and Champion Motors to push mobility-as-a-service (MaaS). Volkswagen Group, Intel’s Mobileye and Champion Motors partnered to commercialize mobility as-a-service with autonomous vehicles in Israel. The three companies will work on different aspects of the project which is being dubbed as “New Mobility in Israel” has been accepted by the government which be furnishing legal and regulatory support, sharing the required infrastructure and traffic data, and providing access to infrastructure as needed. The deployment will begin in 2019 and it will be rolled out in phases reaching full commercialization in 2022. A report by Strategy Analytics estimates that autonomous driving technology will enable a new passenger economy worth $7 trillion in 2050, out of which consumer use of a range of mobility-as-a-service offerings will account for $3.7 trillion, more than 50% of all revenues. Driverless cars present a number of social and economic benefits along with the promise of safety, efficiency and convenience as well as mobility. NHSTA says, “The continuing evolution of automotive technology aims to deliver even greater safety benefits and—one day—deliver Automated Driving Systems (ADS) that can handle the whole task of driving when we don’t want to or can’t do it ourselves.” It is estimated that 94% of serious crashes are due to human error. This means that driver assistance technologies in today’s motor vehicles are already helping to save lives and prevent injuries. The technology won’t just help reduce accidents and injuries but even the economic and social costs due to such incidents. These vehicles would enable smoother flow of traffic thereby reducing congestion and fuel consumption. The technology will be a boon for people with limited options of mobility. The advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) market is projected to reach $91.83 billion by 2025, from $24.24 billion in 2018 at a CAGR of 20.96%. While the global autonomous driving market is expected to grow up to $173.15 billion by 2030. Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. Overall, the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles presents a great opportunity for technology provider which are becoming an integral part of the automotive ecosystem.

266,"Is this another case of “seek and ye shall find” or have U.S. foes actually been increasingly resorting to cyberwars when they feel threatened by the world’s only superpower? For years, Russia has been seen as the leader of politically-instigated cyberwars against the U.S., frequently using them as tools to gain leverage and force the country to the negotiating table. Well, it’s probably not a coincidence that China and Iran, two nations whose relations with the U.S. have recently taken a turn for the worse, having escalated cyberattacks against the country with China even overtaking Russia as the biggest source of state-sponsored cyberattacks. There has been a surge of attacks on businesses and government agencies in the United States from Chinese and Iranian hackers, with experts fearing that America’s trade conflict with China and Washington’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal last year could be at the epicenter of the unfolding drama. State-sponsored attacks And, evidence suggests that these are not the work of isolated felons but rather are state-sponsored hacks that the two governments could be using for political expediency. Earlier this month, the Justice Department unsealed indictments against seven Iranians for conducting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against US banks. This is not the first time that Iranian citizens have been indicted for cyberattacks on US businesses, with an eerily similar case having happened nearly three years ago. Iran faced its first sanctions by the US four decades ago after a group of radicals seized the American embassy in Tehran and has faced several more down the line. But according to the New York Times, recent attacks have been more extensive than previously reported though actual details have not been divulged. The attacks have been attributed to the country by the National Security Agency (NSA) and FireEye Inc. (FEYE), a publicly-traded security firm, during last month’s government shutdown. According to intelligence officials, the Iranian attacks coincided with renewed Chinese offensive aimed at stealing trade and military secrets from American tech and military contractors. In December, two Chinese hackers were indicted by the DoJ for a decade-long global state-sponsored hacking campaign that saw trade secrets stolen from at least 45 US tech companies including icons such as IBM, Hewlett Packard and NASA. Even Chinese smartphone giant , HuaweiTechnologies Co., has not been spared with the country pressing charges against, and demanding the extradition of, the company’s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, for stealing trade secrets from mobile operator T-Mobile USA Inc. Same old… Now we’re moving backwards. China’s prolific attacks on the U.S. have resumed after a brief hiatus--all thanks to the ongoing trade hostilities between the two nations. After many years of economically-motivated cyberattacks on U.S. businesses, presidents Obama and Xi Jinping managed to reach a landmark agreement in 2015 that was meant to put a stop on Chinese industrial-espionage: ""We've agreed that neither the US or the Chinese government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information for commercial advantage,"" Obama enthused. It came as a pleasant surprise that China did stick to its end of the deal. According to a 2016 report by FireEye, the number of attacks originating from China fell 83 percent after the deal, another strong confirmation that a large chunk of attacks coming from the country are state-sponsored. Unfortunately, the ceasefire was only to be short-lived. Quite tellingly, the latest wave of attacks by Beijing are closely aligned to the country’s ambitious “Made in China 2025” initiative that aims to make Beijing shift from the world’s factory floor to higher value products and services. It’s going to be interesting to see how the two nations will address the highly contentious problem of intellectual property theft in the just-resumed trade talks. But so far it appears quite clear that new aggressive policies are creating a cyberattack revival.

267,"Fast-growing video-streaming specialist iQiyi (IQ) has a lot to prove when it reports fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. iQiyi shares have plunged some 53% since peaking last spring. Often referred to as the “Netflix (NFLX) of China,” iQiyi has begun to trade like its U.S. rival. The leading streaming player in China went public some ten months ago priced at $18 per share. After closing on its first day of trading at just above $15 per share, iQiyi saw its value nearly triple by June, reaching $46 per share, only to give it all back after bottoming out around $14.35 in January. If that sounds a like new Netflix, iQiyi investors should be excited. But as with Netflix, it’s going to be a bumpy ride. On the bright side, iQiyi has already made a name for itself by capturing billions of eyeballs in the world's most populous country. But it has fallen victim to the U.S./China trade war spat. What’s more, China's weakening economy has analysts more cautious about the company’s ability to quickly turn a profit. Still, investors who have waited for a better entry point in iQiyi may want to consider the recent correction as a solid buying opportunity. As Netflix and Hulu has demonstrated, streaming video is here to stay. Plus, iQiyi is taking advantage and the binge-watching trend and continues to grow its premium subscriber base. So a strong top- and bottom-line beat Thursday, combined with upside guidance, can help the Chinese tech company regain some Wall Street love. For the three months that ended December, the Beijing-based tech company is expected to report a per-share loss of 65 cents per share on revenue of $982.51 million. This compares to the third quarter when it reported loss of 63 cents per share on revenue of $1.03 billion. For the full year, the per-share loss is expected to be $2.44, while full-year revenue is expected to reach $3.64 billion. In the last-reported quarter, the company delivered revenues that surged 48% year over year. Owing to its content portfolio strength, iQiyi saw strong demand for company-produced drama series as well as original movies, which drove an almost 90% surge in total subscribers which reached 80.7 million. The company also issued a strong Q4 revenue guidance range of $943.5 million to $982.8 million, which calls growth in the range of 43% to 49%. On Thursday investors and analysts will want to see if these momentum growth trends can continue. Investors will also look for any signs to suggest iQiyi can accelerate profitability, which analysts don't expect to see until 2022. In terms of valuations, iQiyi stock trades at about four times its trailing revenue, which is less than half of Netflix's multiple of 10. And given that iQiyi growing its business at a faster rate, there’s a chance the stock may catch up. That’s a risk-reward profile investors must reconcile.",Richard Saintvilus,"February 21, 2019, 08:13:52 AM EDT",iQiyi (IQ) 4th Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
268,"Getty images Dropbox (DBX) will report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. The cloud content management company has quickly asserted itself as a leader within the fast-growing industry, specializing in storage and sharing of documents, photos and files. Dropbox, which makes money by selling cloud subscriptions to its product, delivered a beat on both the top and bottom lines in the third quarter, reporting 11 cents per share on $360 million in revenue. And despite the company issuing upside Q4 guidance, investors are worried whether it can ultimately escape the shadows of its bigger competitors — namely Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). But Dropbox management understand these threats, announcing last month a deal to acquire HelloSign — an electronic signature and document workflow platform — for $230 million. With the deal, Dropbox is boosting its value proposition to its customer base, while differentiating itself from its competitors. In essence, the company is creating its self-described 'Dropbox flywheel' which it believes creates network effects. On Thursday the company must convince analysts that it can quickly bring synergy to this deal. For the three months that ended December, the San Francisco-based company is expected to earn 8 cents per share on revenue of $370.01 million. This compares to the previous quarter when earnings came to 11 cents per share on revenue of $360.3 million. For the full year, earnings are projected to be 38 cents per share, while full-year revenue is seen rising to $1.39 billion. While the threat from larger rivals is a real danger to Dropbox revenue potential, the company has tons of time to combat these threat, given the fact that it’s already profitable. Its deal to acquire HelloSign was the latest example of how it plans to utilize its profits and cash flow. That said, the company on Thursday will need to guide in a way that suggests confidence it can quickly extract value from the deal, given that HelloSign faced its own threats from industry giants DocuSign (DOCU) and Adobe (ADBE). Elsewhere, investors will want to see the fruits of the company’s continuous efforts to strengthen its capabilities in AI technologies, which should continue to drive revenues. The company has developed text-recognition features that allows users to quickly search documents even if they have been saved as images like JPEGs or PNGs. The feature will also recognize text in PDF files if they contain scans or photographs of the document. It remains to be seen how well these new features propel revenue growth. But the company’s focus on enhancing the user experience is one way to not only differentiate itself from competitors, but it also makes Dropbox a potential acquisition target of its own. From a valuation perspective, the stock — currently trading around $26 — is above its $21 IPO price and trades at 68 times fiscal 2018 EPS estimates, compared to a P/E of 18 for the S&P; 500 index.

273,"By now, I am sure there is not a trader or investor alive who is unaware of cloud computing. Most probably even have a rudimentary understanding of what it means; the practice of storing and managing data on remote servers via an internet connection rather than on individual computers or private servers. In most cases, when that level of familiarity is reached in the tech sector, the real opportunities for investors are gone. With cloud computing though, that isn’t the case. Companies such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are still achieving substantial growth in the field, and there is no sign of it stopping yet. The battle for market share between those two tech giants receives a lot of publicity, but there is another, quieter battle for market share being waged to supply the most basic requirement of cloud computing: the processors. It is often said that the people who made the most money off of gold rushes were not the prospectors, but those that supplied the picks, pans and shovels to all of them, successful or not. On that basis, as the big players compete, the best bet for investors may well be to look at suppliers, who win whatever the outcome. That is why Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is so appealing right now.  So far, AMD’s efforts at capturing that market have not been a resounding success. They are way behind rival Intel (INTC) in terms of market share, but in some ways that is why AMD is preferred. INTC can, and almost undoubtedly will, grow substantially as the overall market increases, but the same can be said of AMD, with the added bonus of the potential to increase their share of the pie. Intel controls close to 80% of the processor market overall, with AMD supplying around 20%, but when it comes to server chips the gap is even wider. At the end of last year, AMD’s share of the server chip market was estimated at around 2%, with INTC having almost all the rest. There are two ways of looking at that. Either AMD is struggling and essentially failing, or they have a massive opportunity. With the market still growing, and with recent upgrades to existing products and new ones on the way, the second looks more realistic. Based on past successes, I wouldn’t discourage anyone from owning INTC at this point either, but in a sector where growth is king the law of large numbers comes into play, and it seems that AMD simply has more room to grow explosively. The company anticipates increasing their market share to around 5% before long, which still doesn’t sound like much, but is a 150% increase from their current position. From a technical perspective, the stock looks poised to break through some key resistance at around $25 which would give a short-term boost, and which makes now a good time to buy. Beyond that, there is another, more important short-term factor though, and that is the company’s performance in their core business of CP processors and video cards. Their forecast for this quarter in that area is downbeat, leaving room for an upside surprise. Overall, however, when earnings were released at the end of January, AMD forecast sales growth for this year in the high single digits, besting Wall Street’s estimate for 6% growth and any signs that that is achievable would also provide a short-term boost. Essentially though, this is a long-term play. Data collection, management and processing has gained in importance massively over the last few years and continues to do so. As that dynamic plays out, there are great opportunities for the suppliers to the boom, and AMD, as the fast-growing “upstart” in that area, looks poised to take advantage.",Martin Tillier,"February 20, 2019, 10:42:54 AM EDT",AMD Has Room to Grow in A Growing Business,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1

276,"iStock photo Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), just added electric trucks and SUVs to its broad investment portfolio. Electric truck and SUV startup Rivian just announced that its $700 million funding round is being led by Amazon. The tech giant said that it's inspired by the electric pickup and SUV the company revealed in November at the Los Angeles Auto Show, but there seems to be more in it for the company. The Plymouth, Mich., startup is raising funds to finish development and launch production of the all-electric R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. Deliveries of these electric vehicles to customers in the U.S. are expected to begin in late 2020. “We’re inspired by Rivian’s vision for the future of electric transportation,” Amazon CEO Worldwide Consumer Jeff Wilke said in a statement. “RJ has built an impressive organization, with a product portfolio and technology to match. We’re thrilled to invest in such an innovative company.” Amazon, like many global corporation, expects that electrified transportation will eventually become sizable with government emissions mandates increasing. But there’s another important angle for the company. Led by founder Jeff Bezos, Amazon has been quietly and steadily increasing its presence in the automotive sector — and clearly sees its role expanding as a leader in logistic and delivery. The investor group Amazon is leading for Rivian also includes the investment arm of Abdul Latif Jameel IPR Co. Ltd., a Saudi Arabian conglomerate whose holdings include a major Toyota car and truck distributorship. Sumitomo Corp. also has invested in Rivian. General Motors had been eyeing the startup as an investment, but was not named as part of the Amazon funding deal. In recent years, Amazon has been increasing its presence as a major technology partner to vehicle manufacturers. Amazon’s Alexa system that connects smart phone apps to car dashboards is becoming common in new vehicle offerings. The Alexa Auto SDK will be offered soon and includes all the core Alexa functions like streaming media, smart home controls, weather reports, and will be receiving new features just right for auto users like navigation and search, Amazon says. It ties well into its popular services such as Amazon Music that can be played by drivers going to work. Bezos sees Amazon playing a leading role in autonomous vehicles and supply chain management. That’s likely one of the appealing angles of its investment in Rivian. The startup also has operations in San Jose and Irvine, Calif., where engineers are working on autonomous vehicle technology. Apple's major presence in cloud computing could play a big part in autonomous vehicles through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division. AWS has a long list of corporate customers including global automakers, Tier 1 automotive suppliers and mobility company startups. Its “secure, agile and scalable platform can help accelerate your pace of innovation, improve your security posture and lower your IT cost structure,” Amazon’s website pitches to potential clients. The tech giant has been exploring its place in the global logistics sector, which Transparency Market Research expects to reach $15.5 trillion by 2023. Amazon isn’t planning on taking over that market space, but is looking for revenue streams and operating cost cutting opportunities in its role as the most prominent and pervasive shopping website in the world — with next day delivery of packages right to your doorstep. XPO Logistics appears to be losing sizable income and stock value from its major client, Amazon, with the client pulling away and getting into its own delivery services. Delivery giants FedEx and UPS have been downplaying the threat from Amazon, but are watching closely to see if more threats will emerge — including Amazon’s leading role in delivery postage in the U.S. that has provoked anger from President Donald Trump. One way that Amazon will be cutting costs and increasing income on the delivery front is through its flying drones. That will be taking place through Amazon Prime Air, a service that will deliver packages up to five pounds in 30 minutes or less using its small drones. The tech giant hasn’t specified when it will become a service available to the public. Amazon and UPS are competing to offer the best delivery drones, with both companies testing package delivery that could drastically cut operating costs in the near future. In late 2017, Amazon was awarded a patent that could benefits buyers of electric trucks and vans from Rivian. The patent will allow the company to create a drone that can charge electric vehicles, including EVs that are still in driving mode and need more power to get to a charging station. The patent granted to the tech giant also includes a rooftop docking station that the drone can land on to stay connected with the EV and provide power while it continues the trip. It would mean working directly with automakers to be adaptable to the technology, or making aftermarket modifications. Amazon clearly sees EVs tying into its vision as a global leader in logistics and delivery at an affordable price.

278,"The news is out, a major international bank is backing – and releasing – its own cryptocurrency. Well, sort of. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM – Research Report) will be starting trials, over the next few months, of the JPM Coin – a blockchain-based trading token backed by US dollar deposits. The announcement came on February 14. The new coin will be used to facilitate money transfers between the bank’s customers. This move into the cryptocurrency world is definitely something of a surprise, as JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon famously called Bitcoin (BTC) a “fraud” and “stupid” back in 2017. In fact, he said, “I wouldn’t put this high in the category of ‘important things in the world.’” So, what is his bank – one of the world’s major financial institutions – doing, flying the face of the CEO’s conviction? Loving Blockchain The answer lies in the technology. Dimon obviously has little use for Bitcoin and other cryptos – his bank has banned credit card cryptocurrency purchases by customers – but he does like the blockchain. “The blockchain is real,” he told Fox Business. “You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that.” Clearly, Dimon at the very least sees blockchain as a viable mode for transmission of traditional currencies. As a JPMorgan spokesperson put it, “Jamie has been more consistent than people give him credit for. He’s always separated cryptocurrency from the underlying value and the use of blockchain.” Dimon’s and his bank’s stance puts the JPM Coin into better perspective. The new coin will be a non-fluctuating trading token, tied to and redeemable in US dollars deposited by the token’s users. It’s a concept similar to stablecoins, but quite identical. What Sets JPM Coin Apart The main difference lies in the nature of the blockchain behind the token. Where ‘traditional’ blockchain is open to the public, JPM Coin will be backed by a closed system, accessible to the bank’s officers and customers, by permission only. It’s not a fully centralized system, but neither is it the open-source free-for-all that have made cryptos notorious. Another difference lies in the new coin’s use. Where cryptos like Bitcoin are intended to circulate, the JPM Coin is intended to facilitate circulation; each token is redeemable in US dollars, and after it is used in a transfer transaction and redeemed at the other end, the token is destroyed by the bank. JPM Coin is not a freely circulation alternative currency. In short, JPM Coin will be an internal blockchain system for use by JPMorgan Chase bank and its customers, making available the speed and security of blockchain digital currency transfers. It seems, in fact, like a hard swipe at the existing SWIFT system, and the attractions of a fast, international currency transfer should be immediately apparent to anyone who has spent time waiting for SWIFT transfers to post to an account. That alone should generate substantial interest from JPMorgan’s institutional customers. Who is Line to Use JPM Coin Umar Farooq, head of blockchain projects at JPMorgan Chase, says of the new trading token, “Anything that currently exists in the world, as that moves onto the blockchain, this would be the payment leg for that transaction. The applications are frankly quite endless; anything where you have a distributed ledger which involves corporations or institutions can use this.” Specifically, JPMorgan sees three sets of institutional clients for the new digital coin: The new JPM Coin is not designed for the bank’s retail customers. Rather, it is intended as a tool for institutional use, to smooth out and speed up the bank’s largest money movements. Staying in Line with Regulation JPMorgan spokesmen have been clear that the bank’s new blockchain token will be fully complaint with international currency regulation. In a statement, the bank said, “We have always believed in the potential of blockchain technology and we are supportive of cryptocurrencies as long as they are properly controlled and regulated. As a globally regulated bank, we believe we have a unique opportunity to develop the capability in a responsible way with the oversight of our regulators.” This will include tracking all information required by governmental regulators, and ensuring that all clients using JPM’s blockchain are approved, and have passed money-laundering clearances. We’ll leave the last word to the bank’s Farooq. “There is a possibility in the future of a blockchain that is private, except from the regulator. There are various ways to make the regulatory regimes across the world stronger over time.” Author: Michael Marcus",TipRanks,"February 19, 2019, 02:34:56 PM EDT",What Is The New JP Morgan Coin All About?,0,0,0,0,0,-1,1,1,0,1

283,"The future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has been a hot topic since Bitcoin crashed in December 2017. Everyone has an opinion. INVAO looks at the facts. Author: Frank Wagner, CEO and Co-founder of  INVAO “Bitcoin will go to zero,” said Jeff Schumacher from BCG Digital Ventures at the World Economic Forum in January. He was not the only one making such harsh predictions for cryptocurrencies, at what some consider to be the world’s most elite annual gathering. And indeed, the market has been bearish all year round. But, here is what many don’t understand: Cryptos are not dead and what’s happening right now is actually quite normal. Blockchain technology on the Gartner Hype Cycle The technology consulting firm Gartner has come up with the  Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies . According to this theory, most new technologies go through the same 5 stages: Innovation Trigger, Peak of Inflated Expectations, Trough of Disillusionment, Slope of Enlightenment and Plateau of Productivity.  The cycle helps to explain the development of the internet over the last three decades. A comparison between the early days of the internet and the current state of blockchain might not be exact, but there are similarities. For example, the early fascination with the technology, instead of a focus on practical solutions. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the “Peak of Inflated Expectations” was, most likely, when Bitcoin stood at $19,783 in December 2017. If blockchain technology is going to develop according to the Gartner Hype Cycle, there is light at the end of the tunnel. There are two primary reasons to believe that this positive development of blockchain and cryptocurrencies into the future will happen. Firstly, decentralization will become a long-term trend. And secondly, there are several promising signs that blockchain is primed for mass adoption. Decentralization will become a long-term trend Decentralization is going to become one of the most dominant trends in the 21 st  century. New technologies could greatly enhance transparency, reduce costs, and increase our independence from central institutions. With the introduction of the internet, various forms of a “shared economy” emerged, for example through peer-to-peer lending platforms. Despite this development, the internet’s “shared economy” is not decentralized. There are many ‘middlemen’ involved, and some of these have created massive centralized data monopolies. As a result, corporations and governments often have access to our data and may use it for purposes that are outside of our control. Decentralization has the power to reverse this trend. In the past, Open Source Protocols often created value for users, but not for developers. Blockchain-based token systems have changed this, allowing developers to monetize decentralized platforms. In the future, we will see more of these systems being introduced into the marketplace as developers take advantage of this opportunity. Blockchain technology is primed for mass adoption While some do think the value of Bitcoin will go to zero, the data suggests otherwise. The number of on-chain transactions and the percentage of high-value cross-border transactions have been increasing. More trading activity means more dynamic markets and increased proliferation of the technology. Corporations are also investing more resources into global cryptocurrency mining, which supports the value of cryptocurrencies. A second trend that points towards long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies is the fact that many governments have begun to create a legal basis for the technology. More nations are introducing crypto regulations, including Singapore, Russia, France, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. Transnational regulations are also being discussed. In December 2018, two leading European financial market watchdogs advised the EU-Commission to investigate pan-European regulation of digital assets. Thirdly, large corporations are implementing blockchain projects. The World Economic Forum has forecasted that  10%  of the global GDP will be based on blockchain technology by 2025. Moreover, institutional investors, who have so far stayed away from blockchain technology, have signaled their readiness to pour funds into the industry. Fidelity, for example, one of the five largest financial services firm globally, will offer crypto custodian and trading services via its newly formed subsidiary Fidelity Digital Asset Services LLC. Morgan Stanley, a leading Wall Street bank, has recently declared cryptocurrencies an institutional asset class. Next stage: the Slope of Enlightenment Going back to the Gartner Hype Cycle, we are currently somewhere in the Trough of Disillusionment. Maybe we have already seen the bottom of it, maybe not. It doesn’t matter — what is important is understanding how the journey will continue. Once institutional investors enter the field, increased funding will propel the industry’s development forward. We will also see simplified investment products, that will make it  easy for unsophisticated retail investors to invest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies  without the need to fully understand the technical details. As soon as the first blockchain startups have successfully established themselves in the market, second-generation products and services will emerge. That’s already happening in today’s crypto markets, where new coins are building on the value proposition of existing coins while solving some of their challenges. The Slope of Enlightenment is not far away — we might already be there. From here, the industry can only move forward, and it might accelerate faster than most of us think.
